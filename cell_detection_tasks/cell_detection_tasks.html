      CELL_DETECTION_TASKS <br> Independent Execution of Multiple Tasks
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CELL_DETECTION_TASKS</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      creates modified versions of a sequence of gray-scale TIF files containing
      images of cells; the process of each file is carried out independently,
      using the "task" feature of MATLAB's parallel computing toolbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key idea is that a single "job" is created, but the job is defined
      to comprise a number of tasks.  Each task, in turn, is defined as
      a MATLAB function to be executed with certain arguments.  Once the job
      is defined, it can be submitted, and the tasks will be carried out,
      in somewhat arbitrary order, and perhaps on a variety of different
      processors.  In any case, once all the tasks are finished, it is
      possible to access the functional output from all the tasks; even though
      the tasks were carried out in an arbitrary fashion, their output
      was collected and saved.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, each task involves processing a single frame of an
      animation.  Each frame is a gray scale image of biological cells, and
      the (rather complicated) graphics operation involves simply identifying
      cells and surrounding them with a thin white boundary.  The point of
      the example is that independent tasks can each open a separate
      input file, carry out some operations on the data, and write corresponding
      output files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, in this case, the output of the tasks is a collection of data files
      that can be turned, perhaps, into an animation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is based on an example for parallel batch processing
      (using the PARFOR command originally) of images, found on the MathWorks
      web site in the Image Processing Toolbox demos area.
