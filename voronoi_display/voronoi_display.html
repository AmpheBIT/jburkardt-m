      VORONOI_DISPLAY <br> Compute and Display a Voronoi Diagram
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>VORONOI_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads a file of 2D points, computes the Voronoi diagram,
      and displays an image of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      A related program, <b>table_voronoi()</b>, computes the same information
      returns it as output arguments, and prints it out.  This function is 
      provided partially simply to verify that the information returned by
      table_voronoi() is correct, and can be used to construct the diagram.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should be aware that MATLAB includes functions <b>voronoi()</b>
      and <b>voronoin()</b> which already compute the Voronoi diagram
      accurately and efficiently.  
    </p>

    <p>
      However, these functions do not seem to
      return information about the semi-infinite Voronoi cells that is
      necessary for certain applications, such as computing the areas of the
      cells of a Voronoi diagram that is confined to a box.  In such a case,
      we expect the semi-infinite regions to lie partially inside and outside
      the box, and it is not too difficult to determine the (finite) portion
      of such regions that lies within the box.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>VORONOI_DISPLAY</b> computes the Voronoi diagram by calling the
      GEOMPACK library of Barry Joe.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The program then analyzes the
      Delaunay information returned from GEOMPACK to work out the
      location of the Voronoi vertices, their specific arrangement 
      around each of the original data nodes, and the handling of the
      semi-infinite rays.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the program displays the Voronoi diagram, drawing the
      semi-infinite edges each with an arbitrary length of one unit.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the analysis, the program begins with the pointset, of which a 
      typical element
      is a point <b>G</b>.  Each <b>G</b> generates a Voronoi polygon (or 
      semi-infinite region, which we will persist in calling a polygon).
      A typical vertex of the polygon is called <b>V</b>.    For the semi-infinite
      regions, we have a vertex at infinity, but it's really not helpful to
      store a vertex (Inf,Inf), since we have lost information about the
      direction from which we reach that infinite vertex.  We will have to
      treat these special regions with a little extra care, and in fact,
      we will generally end up with <b>two</b> "vertices at infinity" associated
      with each semi-infinite region.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are interested in computing the following quantities:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>G_DEGREE</b>, for generator <b>G</b>, the degree (number of
          vertices) of the Voronoi polygon;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>G_START</b>, for generator <b>G</b>, the index of the first 
          Voronoi vertex in a traversal of the sides of the Voronoi polygon;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>G_FACE</b>, for all generators <b>G</b>, the sequence of Voronoi
          vertices in a traversal of the sides of the Voronoi polygon.  
          A traversal of a semi-infinite polygon begins at an "infinite"
          vertex, lists the finite vertices, and then ends with a 
          (different) infinite vertex.  Infinite vertices are given
          negative indexes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>V_NUM</b>, the number of (finite) Voronoi vertices <b>V</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>V_XY</b>, for each finite Voronoi vertex <b>V</b>, 
          the XY coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I_NUM</b>, the number of Voronoi vertices at infinity;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I_XY</b>, the "direction" associated with each Voronoi vertex
          at infinity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      So if we have to draw a semi-infinite region, we start at infinity.
      We then need to draw a line from infinity to vertex #2.  We do so
      by drawing a line in the appropriate direction, stored in I_XY.
      Having safely reached finite vertex #2, we can connect the finite
      vertices, until it is time to draw another line to infinity, this
      time in another direction, also stored in I_XY.
