      TIC_TOC <br> MATLAB Functions for Elapsed Time
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TIC_TOC</b> 
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which 
      consider the MATLAB tic and toc functions for computing elapsed time.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB includes two functions tic and <b>TOC</b>.  If <b>TIC</b>
      is called before something is to be timed, and <b>TOC</b> is called
      afterward, then <b>TOC</b> will either print the elapsed wallclock
      time if its value is not being copied to a variable, or return the 
      value of the elapsed wallclock time to a variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      To time an entire program, the simplest method to get the elapsed
      wallclock time is to call tic before you run the program
      and <b>toc</b> afterwards:
      <pre>
        tic
        my_program
        toc
      </pre>
      If <b>toc</b> is called without an output argument, it prints the elapsed time.
      or you can save the output from <b>toc</b> and print it yourself.
      <pre>
        tic
        my_program
        wtime = toc
        fprintf ( 1, '  MY_PROGRAM took %f seconds to run.\n', wtime );
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For parallel programming, the important thing to measure is the elapsed
      wallclock time.  This can be found by subtracting an initial reading of
      the wallclock time from a final one.

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>TIC_TOC_TEST</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "tic_toc_test.m">tic_toc_test.m</a>, 
          calls all the tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "tic_toc_test_output.txt">tic_toc_test_output.txt</a>, 
          the output file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "timestamp.m">timestamp.m</a>, 
          prints the YMDHMS date as a timestamp.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TIC_TOC_PRINTING</b> calls TIC, and then immediately calls TOC several
      times.  If we call the "printing" TOC, then the cost of printing will be
      added to each subsequent TOC.  If we instead store the output of TOC and
      print it later, we get a more reliable result.

          <a href = "tic_toc_printing.m">tic_toc_printing.m</a>, 
          compares two ways to estimate the tic/toc resolution;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "tic_toc_printing_test.m">tic_toc_printing_test.m</a>, 
          calls tic_toc_printing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TIC_TOC_RESOLUTION</b> estimates the resolution of the TIC and TOC commands
      by calling N times and averaging.
