TIC_TOC_TEST
  Test the TIC and TOC functions.

TIC_TOC_RESOLUTION_TEST:
  Estimate the resolution of the TIC/TOC functions by calling
  N times and averaging.

TIC_TOC_PRINTING_TEST:
  We can estimate the resolution of the TIC/TOC call by
  calling them one after the other, with no work in between.

  So calling TIC, and then calling TOC several times, might
  seem to give us more estimates to compare.

  However, we must realize that calling TOC with the
  printing option adds the printing time to the next measurement
  of elapsed time.

  A: Call TIC once, then call TOC five times.

Elapsed time is 0.000001 seconds.
Elapsed time is 0.000006 seconds.
Elapsed time is 0.000008 seconds.
Elapsed time is 0.000010 seconds.
Elapsed time is 0.000012 seconds.

  B: Call TIC once, then call T=TOC five times,
  storing the value.  Afterwards, print the five values.
  Notice that calling the "printing" TOC adds the printing time
  to the next elapsed time.

Elapsed time is 0.0000004390 seconds
Elapsed time is 0.0000024730 seconds
Elapsed time is 0.0000032380 seconds
Elapsed time is 0.0000038630 seconds
Elapsed time is 0.0000043770 seconds

TIC_TOC_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
