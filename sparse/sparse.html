    <hr>
 
    <p>
      <b>SPARSE</b> 
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which 
      demonstrate the use of the MATLAB "sparse" function 
      for creating a sparse matrix.  
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      MATLAB's SPARSE function
    </h2>

    <p>
      MATLAB provides a <b>sparse</b> function of the form
      <blockquote><b>
        matrix = sparse ( i, j, s, m, n, nz_max )
      </b></blockquote>
      This function can be used to create a sparse matrix.
      The input arguments have the following meaning:
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>i</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the row indices of the nonzero elements;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>j</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the column indices of the nonzero elements;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>s</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the values of the nonzero elements;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>m</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the number of rows in the matrix;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>n</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the number of columns in the matrix;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>nz_max</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the maximum number of nonzero elements in the matrix;
          <b>nz_max</b> is commonly omitted, in which case its value
          is taken from the length of <b>s</b>.  
        </dd>
      </dl>
      Note that <b>nz_max</b> is commonly omitted, in which case its value
      is taken from the length of <b>s</b>.  Moreover, if you specify
      <b>nz_max</b> explicitly, or implicitly through the size of <b>s</b>,
      MATLAB will allow you to increase the number of nonzero elements
      at any time.  Specifying <b>nz_max</b> correctly, then, is simply
      a matter of efficiency.

      Example: Creating a Sparse Matrix at Once
    </h3>

    <p>
      Although this is not the usual way to use the <b>sparse</b>
      command, the following example should help to understand what
      is going on.  We mean to define the following matrix:
      <pre>
        11  12   0   0  15
         0  22  23   0   0
        31   0  33  34  35
      </pre>
      by the following MATLAB commands:
      <pre>
        i = [  1,  1,  1,  2,  2,  3,  3,  3,  3 ];
        j = [  1,  2,  5,  2,  3,  1,  3,  4,  5 ];
        s = [ 11, 12, 15, 22, 23, 31, 33, 34, 35 ];
        m = 3;
        n = 5;
        nz_max = 9;

        a = sparse ( i, j, s, m, n, nz_max );
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Example: Building a Sparse Matrix in Steps
    </h3>

    <p>
      Of course, in many applications, the matrix data is only
      available one piece at a time, or has to be modified as you go.
      This is easy to do, as well.  You can start by defining the
      matrix to be an "empty" sparse matrix of a particular size,
      as, for example:
      <pre>
        i = [];
        j = [];
        s = [];
        m = 100;
        n = 100;
        a = sparse ( i, j, s, m, n );
      </pre>
      The matrix will be empty, and entries of the matrix are
      by default equal to zero.  Then you can simply reference 
      entries of the matrix as you need them.  For instance,
      <pre>
        a(1,1) = 3
        a(3,8) = a(3,8) + 7    
        a(4,7) = a(9,5) + 2 * a(8,12)
        a(4,7) = a(4,7) + 1
      </pre>
      If you reference, on the right hand side of these equations,
      a matrix entry that doesn't exist, it is by default zero.
      If you assign a value on the left hand side to a matrix entry
      that doesn't exist, a space is created for it, and it is given 
      this value.  If the entry already existed, it is overwritten.
    </p>

      Useful Commands
    </h3>

    <p>
      In some cases, Matlab's sparse matrix structure allows you
      to ignore the fact that you are using a sparse matrix.  We
      have already seen that you can reference the (i,j) element
      of the matrix in the same way you would do for a full matrix,
      and this is true whether you are simply asking to "read" the
      current value of the element, or to "write" a new value for
      the element.
    </p>

    <p>
      A particular example of this is the fact that you can
      solve a sparse linear system using the same "backslash"
      formula that you would use if the matrix were full:
      <blockquote><b>
        x = A \ b;
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Matlab includes many commands specifically for dealing with
      a sparse matrix.  For our examples, we will be considering 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>nnz(A)</b> returns the number of nonzero matrix elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>nzmax(A)</b> returns the maximum number of nonzero
          matrix elements allocated;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>find(A)</b> returns all (i,j) indices of nonzero elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>nonzeros(A)</b> returns all the nonzero elements;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that, in a sense, MATLAB actually uses <i>two</i> formats 
      for sparse matrices.  The user communicates with MATLAB by specifying
      what is known as a <i>sparse triplet</i>, that is, a set of 
      row indices, column indices, and values.  But internally, MATLAB
      uses what is known as the <i>sparse compressed column</i> format.
      This format allows MATLAB to access matrix entries rapidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      To copy the nonzero entries from a sparse matrix, creating the sparse
      triplet structure:
      <pre>
        [i,j,s] = sparse ( A );
        [m,n] = size ( A );
      </pre>
      Correspondingly, to create the sparse matrix from this data:
      <pre>
        A = sparse ( i, j, s, m, n );
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      When using MATLAB's sparse matrix format, it is possible to refer to
      matrix entries directly, using the usual index notation like A(i,j).
      However, accessing specific entries in this way, whether to initialize,
      extract, increment, or zero them, is an expensive process.  The
      MathWorks suggests extracting the sparse triplet information, working
      on it in the natural way, and then "repacking" it with the sparse()
      command.
