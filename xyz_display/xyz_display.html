      Display 3D Points in the MATLAB Graphics Window
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>XYZ_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads the name of a data file
      containing a list of 3D point coordinates, reads the data,
      and displays the points in the MATLAB graphics window.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file containing the point coordinates is in the <b>XYZ</b>
      format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MATLAB command <b>scatter3</b>
      is used to display the points.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>xyz_display</b> ( <i>'filename.xyz'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'filename.xyz'</i> is a file of XYZ point coordinate data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      and displays a plot of the points.
