    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ODE_SWEEP_SERIAL</b>
      is a directory which
      computes the solution of an ODE for many parameter values, keeping track
      of the maximum absolute value of the solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the parameterized second order differential equation:
      <pre>
        m x'' + b x' + k x = 0
      </pre>
      which represents the behavior of a spring mass system with a
      mass of <b>m</b>, a spring constant of <b>k</b> and a damping
      coefficient <b>b</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now suppose that we are interested in properties of the solution <b>x(t)</b>
      over the time interval from 0 to 25 seconds, as we vary the physical properties
      <b>b</b> and <b>k</b>.  In particular, we would like to know the maximum value
      of <b>x(t)</b> over the time interval for each choice of the physical parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer this question, we must solve the ODE for each choice of the parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The basic function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function peakVals = ode_fun ( bVals, kVals )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          bVals is an array of B values;
        </li>
        <li>
          kVals is an array of K values;
        </li>
        <li>
          peakVals is an array containing the maximum value of the ODE solution
          for each combination of B and K.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
