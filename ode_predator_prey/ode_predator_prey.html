      ODE_PREDATOR_PREY <br> ODE Solution of a Predator Prey System
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ODE_PREDATOR_PREY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which 
      applies the ODE23 function to estimate solutions of a
      pair of ordinary differential equations that model the behavior of
      a pair of predator and prey populations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical system under consideration is a pair of animal populations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PREY reproduce rapidly; for each animal alive at the beginning of the
      year, two more will be born by the end of the year.  The prey do not have
      a natural death rate; instead, they only die by being eaten by the predator.
      Every prey animal has 1 chance in 1000 of being eaten in a given year by
      a given predator.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PREDATORS only die of starvation, but this happens very quickly.
      If unfed, a predator will tend to starve in about 1/10 of a year.
      On the other hand, the predator reproduction rate is dependent on
      eating prey, and the chances of this depend on the number of available prey.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resulting differential equations can be written:
      <pre>
        PRED(0) = 5000         
        PREY(0) =  100
  
        d PREY / dT =    2 * PREY(T) - 0.001 * PREY(T) * PRED(T)
        d PRED / dT = - 10 * PRED(T) + 0.002 * PREY(T) * PRED(T)
      </pre>
      Here, the initial values (5000,100) are a somewhat arbitrary starting point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pair of ordinary differential equations that result have an interesting
      behavior.  For certain choices of the interaction coefficients (such as
      those given here), the populations of predator and prey will tend to 
      a periodic oscillation.  The two populations will be out of phase; the number
      of prey will rise, then after a delay, the predators will rise as the prey
      begins to fall, causing the predator population to crash again.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this program, the pair of ODE's is solved by calling MATLAB's ODE23 function.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>ode_predator_prey</b> ( <i>[ pred, prey ]</i>, <i>[ t0, t_max ]</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>[ pred, prey ]</i> is a vector containing the initial numbers of
          predators and prey at the initial time;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>[ t0, t_max ]</i> is a vector containing the initial and final time;
        </li>
      </ul>
      The program uses ODE23 to estimate the solution from T0 to T_MAX, and
      displays a plot of the pair of solution curves.
