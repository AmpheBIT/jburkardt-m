      SVD_FINGERPRINT <br> SVD Compression of Fingerprint Images
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SVD_FINGERPRINT</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads a file containing a fingerprint image and 
      uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) to
      compute and display a series of low rank approximations to the image.
    </p>

    <p>
      In MATLAB, images can be thought of as numeric arrays (although you
      do have to convert them from the uint8 numeric format used for images
      to the double format used for numeric arrays.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, an MxN image A has an SVD decomposition A = U*S*V'.
    </p>

    <p>
      For any 1 <= R <= min(M,N), a low rank approximation to A is formed by
      <pre>
        Ar = U(1:m,1:r) * S(1:r,1:r) * V(1:n,1:r)';
      </pre>
      Properties of the SVD guarantee that Ar is the best possible rank R approximation
      to the data in A.  This means it is often possible to get a good approximation
      to A using much less data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regarding a fingerprint image as collection of column vectors, we can apply
      this technique.  Fingerprints can be difficult to compress, since they have
      a great deal of fine variation and detail.

      <b>FINGERPRINT_01</b> analyzes the data in the file "fingerprint_01.png".
      Note that the PNG format can include a hidden form of compression,
      which we are ignoring for this exercise.  (Take a look at the size, in bytes,
      of the original PNG file and the sequence of compressed versions.)
      We are concerned about compressed representation of the image once it 
      has been read into memory and stored as an array of MxN black/white values.
