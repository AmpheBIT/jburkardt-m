      MATLAB_CONDOR <br> Running MATLAB Under the CONDOR Batch Queueing System
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_CONDOR</b>
      is a directory of examples which
      demonstrate how a MATLAB program can be submitted to the CONDOR batch
      queueing system.
    </p>

    <p>
      CONDOR allows a user to submit jobs for batch execution on an informal
      cluster composed of various computers that often have idle time.
      Based on information from the user's submission file, CONDOR chooses
      one or more appropriate and available computers, transfers files to the
      target systems, executes the program, and returns data to the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      CONDOR has many features, and its proper use varies from site to site.
      The information in this document was inspired by the CONDOR system 
      supported by the FSU Research Computing Center (RCC).  Some of the
      information therefore is peculiar to this local installation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing to note is that executing MATLAB is done indirectly.
      The user has a MATLAB program or script to run, of course.  Let's
      say the main user script is called "program.m".  In order for this
      script to be run through CONDOR, we need to write a BASH shell script
      that "knows" where MATLAB is stored, knows how to invoke MATLAB
      for a noninteractive job, and knows the name of the user
      script.  Such a shell script might be called "program_run.sh", and
      look like this:
      <pre>
        #!/bin/bash
        /opt/matlab/current/bin/matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -nojvm -r "run('./program.m'); quit"
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the user must write a CONDOR script that copies necessary files
      to an unknown machine, executes the shell script, which executes MATLAB,
      which executes the user's MATLAB commands, and then copies the output
      files back.  The script might be called "program.condor".
    </p>

    <p>
      The user must then log into the CONDOR submit node interactively:
      <blockquote>
        ssh condor-login.rcc.fsu.edu
      </blockquote>
      and, if necessary, transfer the CONDOR script, the BASH script, and 
      the MATLAB files to this node using SFTP, and then submit the CONDOR
      script with a command like:
      <blockquote>
        condor_submit program.condor
      </blockquote>
      The user can check on the status of the job with the command
      <pre>
        condor_q
      </pre>
      If all goes well, the job output will be returned to the CONDOR
      submit node.
      However, if things do not go well, or the job is taking too much
      time, user "username" can delete all jobs in the condor queue with 
      the command
      <pre>
        condor_rm username
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Using Files:
    </h3>

    <p>
      On the FSU RCC Condor cluster, you must first copy your files to the 
      CONDOR login machine.  When you submit your job to the CONDOR queue,
      however, the program execution will take place on some unknown machine,
      which initially does not have any of your files - and may not even
      have the executable program you want to use, unless it is MATLAB, 
      for instance.  Therefore, an important part of using CONDOR is 
      making sure that you copy to the remote machine all the files needed
      for input, make sure the remote machine already has the executable,
      or send a copy, and then copy all your output files back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the file system is not shared, the following commands should
      appear in your CONDOR script:
      <pre>
        should_transfer_files = yes
        when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
      </pre>
      that allows you to specify the name of this file.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your executable reads from "standard input", then your CONDOR
      job will need a file containing that information.  CONDOR includes a
      command of the form
      <pre>
        input = filename
      </pre>
      that allows you to specify the name of this file.  Similarly, if
      your program writes to "standard output", CONDOR allows you to
      specify the name of a file where this information will go:
      <pre>
        output = filename
      </pre>
      and if your program writes to the "standard error" device,
      you can specify this with
      <pre>
        error = filename
      </pre>
      The input file must exist on your CONDOR login node before you submit
      the job.  The output and error files are created during the run, and
      will automatically be copied back to your CONDOR login node when the
      job is completed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your job may require many more files to run than simply the standard
      input file.  In particular, a MATLAB job will usually need one or more
      M files.  You need to tell CONDOR the names of these files, in a 
      comma-separated list:
      <pre>
        transfer_input_files = file1, file2, ..., file99
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Your job may create many files aside from simply standard output.
      Luckily, all files created by the run will be automatically copied back.
    </p>

    <p>
      We happen to know that MATLAB is installed on certain CONDOR nodes.
      To guarantee that CONDOR sends our job to such a node, we use a
      command like the following:
      <pre>
        requirements = ( OpSYS="LINUX" &amp;&amp; Arch=="X86_64 &amp;&amp; Matlab=="true" )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run a MATLAB job on the remote machine, we have to use a special
      form of the MATLAB command that specifies where the program is,
      how it is to be run, and what M file it is to execute.  This is done
      by writing a short BASH shell script.  If our M file is called
      "my_prog.m", then the script could be called "run_my_prog.sh",
      and could look like this:
      <pre>
        #!/bin/bash
        /opt/matlab/current/bin/matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -nojvm -r "run('./myprog.m') quit"
      </pre>
      Essentially, CONDOR will treat this shell script as your "executable",
      so your CONDOR script must include the statement:
      <pre>
        executable = run_my_prog.sh
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      A Sample CONDOR Script for MATLAB
    </h3>

    <p>
      Here is a file called "my_prog.condor":
      <pre>
        universe = vanilla
        executable = run_my_prog.sh
        arguments =
        input =
        requirements = ( OpSYS="LINUX" &amp;&amp; Arch=="X86_64 &amp;&amp; Matlab=="true" )
        should_transfer_files = yes
        transfer_input_files = my_prog.m
        when_to_transfer_files = on_exit
        notification = never
        output = output.txt
        log = log.txt
        error = error.txt
        queue
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A few comments are in order.  
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "universe" command is required,
          and on the FSU CONDOR system, we only have the "vanilla" universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "arguments" command allows you to pass commandline arguments to
          the executable program.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting "notification" to "yes" will cause CONDOR to send you
          email when the job completes, and perhaps at some other stages as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "log" command species a name to use for the file in which CONDOR
          records the progress of the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "error" command allows you to capture output to standard error.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "queue" command is necessary, and tells CONDOR to actually
          begin running your job.
        </li>
      </ul>
