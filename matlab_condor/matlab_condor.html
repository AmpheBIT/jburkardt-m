      MATLAB_CONDOR <br> Running MATLAB Under the CONDOR Batch Queueing System
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_CONDOR</b>
      is a directory of examples which
      demonstrate how a MATLAB program can be submitted to the CONDOR batch
      queueing system.
    </p>

    <p>
      CONDOR allows a user to submit jobs for batch execution on an informal
      cluster composed of various computers that often have idle time.
      Based on information from the user's submission file, CONDOR chooses
      one or more appropriate and available computers, transfers files to the
      target systems, executes the program, and returns data to the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      CONDOR has many features, and its proper use varies from site to site.
      The information in this document focuses on the task of getting a MATLAB
      job to run under the CONDOR system installed on a collection of computers
      under the management of the FSU Department of Scientific Computing.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB users who invoke CONDOR must note a particular restriction.
      CONDOR will only run MATLAB on one of the machines in the departmental 
      classroom.  The department has just 15 MATLAB licenses available for
      classroom use.  That means that, during typical class times, you should
      be aware that each MATLAB job you run subtracts from this fixed limit.
      That means CONDOR jobs requiring many copies of MATLAB should be run
      at night, on the weekends, or holidays!
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB is typically used interactively, but it is possible for it to
      do everything in a batch mode.  For this purpose, the user must prepare
      a script containing the commands that might ordinarily be given 
      interactively.  For more information on this requirement, see the
      information on <b>MATLAB_COMMANDLINE</b> listed below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that, in a typical use of CONDOR, a user would have files on 
      the <b>pamd</b> system, then log into the submission system with the command
      <blockquote>
        ssh submit.sc.fsu.edu
      </blockquote>
      and move to the directory containing the submission file.  To submit the job
      described by the <i>simple.condor</i> file, for instance, the next command would be:
      <blockquote>
        condor_submit simple.condor
      </blockquote>

      <b>SIMPLE</b> is a simple example, in which a MATLAB function is to
      be called with certain output.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple.condor">simple.condor</a>,
          the CONDOR submission file.  This is used by issuing the command
          "condor_submit simple.condor".
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple_script.m">simple_script.m</a>,
          the MATLAB script which sets up some data and calls a function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple_function.m">simple_function.m</a>,
          the MATLAB function, which simply adds the two input arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple.mat">simple.mat</a>,
          the MATLAB MAT file which contains the workspace at the end of
          the computation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple_output.txt">simple_output.txt</a>,
          the output printed by MATLAB.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple.error">simple.error</a>,
          CONDOR's error file (empty, because for once we didn't make a mistake).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple.log">simple.log</a>,
          CONDOR's log file (records the job submission, execution, and completion).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "simple.out">simple.out</a>,
          CONDOR's output file (empty, because we grabbed the output 
          into simple_output.txt).
