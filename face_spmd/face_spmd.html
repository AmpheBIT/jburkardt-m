      FACE_SPMD <br> SPMD Labs Cooperate to Find a Boundary
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FACE_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the <b>SPMD</b> (single program, multiple data) command
      so that multiple MATLAB workers or "labs" can cooperate in a task.
    </p>

    <p>
      A rectangular box, of dimensions 1x1x3, has been subdivided into
      tetrahedral elements.  These elements are defined by
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>x</b>, a list of 3D point coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>e_conn</b>, a list of sets of 4 point indices, representing
          the four points that define each tetrahedron.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is desired to determine the triangular faces that lie on a
      boundary face of the box.  The boundary face is described by the
      variable (one of X, Y, or Z) that is held constant, along with bounds
      for the other two variables.  Thus, the output of the program will
      be a list of triples of point indices, with each triple representing
      a triangular face of a tetrahedron.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        <i>F_conn</i> = <b>face_fun</b> ( <i>x</i>, <i>e_conn</i>, <i>ii</i>, <i>val_ii</i>,
          <i>xj_lb</i>, <i>xj_ub</i>, <i>xk_lb</i>, <i>xk_ub</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>x</i>, the list of 3D point coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>e_conn</i>, a list of sets of 4 point indices, representing
          the four points that define each tetrahedron.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>ii</i>, the index of the "I" variable, which is constant on the
          boundary plane.  If the constant variable is X, then II is 1, and so on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>val_ii</i>, the value of the constant "I" variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>xj_lb</i>, <i>xj_ub</i>, the upper and lower bounds
          for the "J" nonconstant variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>xk_lb</i>, <i>xk_ub</i>, the upper and lower bounds
          for the "K" nonconstant variable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The "J" and "K" variables are the first and second variables to follow
      the "I" variable, assuming that we are counting with wrap around.
      There are thus three possibilities for I, J and K:
<pre>
    I  J  K
   -- -- --
    1  2  3
    2  3  1
    3  1  2
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
