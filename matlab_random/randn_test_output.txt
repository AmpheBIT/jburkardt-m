RANDN_TEST:
  MATLAB version
  Test the MATLAB RAND function.

RANDN_TEST01:
  In MATLAB, normal random numbers are generated by calling RANDN:

  A = randn ( )      a random scalar value.
  B = randn ( 5, 1 ) a random column vector of 5 entries.
  C = randn ( 1, 5 ) a random row vector of 5 entries.
  D = randn ( 3, 4 ) a 3 by 4 random matrix.
  E = randn ( 5 )    a 5 by 5 random matrix.

a =

   -1.6699


b =

   -0.2378
    0.6066
    0.3426
    0.9475
    0.9660


c =

    1.6660    0.6552    0.3896    1.3801   -1.0473


d =

   -0.9271   -0.9132   -0.4576   -1.2220
   -0.9434    0.1850    0.1884   -0.7943
    0.2594    0.2361   -1.3579    1.5094


e =

    0.5062   -1.5806    0.4548    0.9239    2.0445
   -0.1600   -1.0477    0.8903   -1.1909    1.8474
    0.9218   -1.5473   -0.3863    0.6032    0.7629
   -1.4246    0.6133   -1.2991   -1.8730    0.2962
    0.6315    1.6859   -1.0043    1.5803    0.2831


RANDN_TEST02:
  By setting the random number seed, you can control
  how the random number sequence begins.

  The command "rng ( 123456789 )" sets the seed to 123456789.

  Seed has been set to 123456789

  Now generate 5 random values.
  RANDN() = 0.2265
  RANDN() = 0.0256107
  RANDN() = 0.0376636
  RANDN() = 0.364848
  RANDN() = -1.05838

  Seed has been reset to 123456789

  Now generate 5 more random values.
  RANDN() = 0.2265
  RANDN() = 0.0256107
  RANDN() = 0.0376636
  RANDN() = 0.364848
  RANDN() = -1.05838

RANDN_TEST03:
  Compute a lot of random values.

  The average should be 0.0
  The variance should be 1.
