STOCHASTIC_DIFFUSION_TEST:
  Test the STOCHASTIC_DIFFUSION library.

BNT_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_BNT.

  The first plot uses uniform random values for OMEGA.
  The second uses Gaussian (normal) random values.

  Plot file stored as "bnt_contour.png".

ELMAN_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_ELMAN.

  Plot file stored as "elman_contour.png".

NTW_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_NTW.

  Plot file stored as "ntw_contour.png".

XK_CONTOUR
  Display the stochastic diffusivity function
  defined by DIFFUSIVITY_1D_XK.

  Plot file stored as "xk_contour.png".

STOCHASTIC_DIFFUSION_TEST:
