      TRIANGULATION_L2Q <br> 6-Node Triangulation from 3-Node Triangulation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_L2Q</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads information describing a triangulation of a set of points using 3-node
      ("linear") triangles, and creates a 6-node ("quadratic")
      triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same number of triangles are used, but each triangle
      is given three extra midside nodes.  The coordinates of 
      these nodes are determined by averaging the coordinates of
      pairs of vertices of the triangles.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input and output files use the simple 
      <a href = "../../data/table/table.html">TABLE format</a>;
      comment lines begin with a "#" character.  Otherwise, each line
      of the file contains one set of information, either the coordinates
      of a node (for a node file), or the indices of nodes that make up
      a triangle, (for a triangle file).
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node information
      for the 3-node triangulation.  Each data line contains the X and 
      Y coordinates of a single node.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt contains the triangle information
      for the 3-node triangulation.  Each line contains the indices of three 
      nodes that form a triangle, in counterclockwise order.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The output file <i>prefix</i>_l2q_nodes.txt contains the node information
      for the 6-node triangulation.  It begins with the node information
      from <i>nodes.txt</i>, followed by the coordinates of the new nodes.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The output file <i>prefix</i>_l2q_elements.txt contains the triangle 
      information for the 6-node triangulation.  There are exactly
      as many triangles as before, but now each triangle uses six nodes.
      Each line of the file contains the indices of 6 nodes that form the
      triangle, listed in a particular order.  The first three
      indices are the vertices, in counterclockwise order.  The fourth
      index is the midside node between vertices 1 and 2, the fifth
      the midside between vertices 2 and 3, and the sixth the midside
      between vertices 3 and 1.  It should be the case that the first
      three columns of <i>prefix</i>_l2q_elements.txt are the same as the
      three columns of <i>prefix</i>elements.txt.
