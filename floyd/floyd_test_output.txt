FLOYD_TEST
  MATLAB version
  Test the routines in the FLOYD library.

FLOYD_TEST01
  I4MAT_FLOYO uses Floyd's algorithm to find the
  shortest distance between all pairs of nodes
  in a directed graph, starting from the initial array
  of direct node-to-node distances.

  In the initial direct distance array, if
    A(I,J) = -1,
  this indicates there is NO directed link from
  node I to node J.  In that case, the value of
  of A(I,J) is essentially "infinity".

  Initial direct distance array:

  Col:       1        2        3        4        5        6  
  Row

    1        0        2        5       -1       -1       -1  
    2       -1        0        7        1       -1        8  
    3       -1       -1        0        4       -1       -1  
    4       -1       -1       -1        0        3       -1  
    5       -1       -1        2       -1        0        3  
    6       -1        5       -1        2        4        0  

  In the final shortest distance array, if
    A(I,J) = -1,
  this indicates there is NO directed path from
  node I to node J.
