      CVT_MOVIE4 <br> Animated CVT Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_MOVIE4</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      animates the generation of a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      The action takes place in a square; however, a nonuniform density
      function is applied, which effectively increases the "weight" of
      regions in the corners; for this iterative algorithm, the effect
      of the density function is that many more sample points will come
      from the corners than from the center.  The CVT cells will 
      correspondingly tend to migrate away from the center.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data that the user may set includes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>N</b>, the number of points to generate, (100 to 300 is
          reasonable)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SAMPLE_NUM</b>, the number of sampling points (10,000 to
          100,000 might be reasonable):
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FRAME_NUM</b>, the number of frames to create (5 or 10
          might be reasonable to start with, 100 is usually plenty).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program proceeds to create a series of 
      <a href = "../../data/jpg/jpg.html">JPG files</a>, each
      containing one frame of the animation.  It is possible to
      create an animation by using software such as Apple QuickTime.
