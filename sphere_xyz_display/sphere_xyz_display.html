      SPHERE_XYZ_DISPLAY <br>
      Display Sphere + 3D Points in the MATLAB Graphics Window
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_XYZ_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads the name of a data file
      containing a list of 3D point coordinates, reads the data,
      and displays a unit sphere and the points in the MATLAB graphics window.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is difficult to visualize a set of points that lie on the unit
      sphere.  You can't see the curving surface, and you can see points
      that should not be visible, because they are on the other side of
      the sphere.  By starting the display with a unit sphere, and then
      adding the 3D points you want to see, both of these problems are
      resolved.  The addition of the sphere gives important visual cues
      as to how to "read" the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file containing the point coordinates is in the <b>XYZ</b>
      format.  The MATLAB command <b>scatter3</b>
      is used to display the points.  The sphere is generated by the
      <b>sphere</b> command and displayed with the <b>surf</b> command.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_XYZ_DISPLAY</b> is essentially a version of <b>XYZ_DISPLAY</b>
      with the addition of a displayed sphere.  It seems like a small change,
      but for spherical point data, it makes a huge difference.

      Usage:

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>sphere_xyz_display</b> ( <i>'filename.xyz'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'filename.xyz'</i> is a file of XYZ point coordinate data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      and displays a plot of the points.

      <b>SPHERE_GRID_ICOS1_F*_XYZ</b> is a family of files containing the
      XYZ coordinates of points on the unit sphere generated by subdividing
      the triangular faces of an icosahedron, and using a naive (secant-based)
      projection method.  The value of F controls the fineness of the subdivision.
