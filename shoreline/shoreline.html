      SHORELINE <br> Triangulate the Domain where 0 <= F(X,Y)
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SHORELINE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      tries to identify and triangulate the 2D domain over which some 
      function F(X,Y) is nonnegative.
    </p>

    <p>
      It does this by starting with a set of sample points, where the function is
      evaluated.  Triangles are dropped from the triangulation if all 3 vertices 
      have negative functions.  Triangles with 3 positive vertices are assumed
      (to within the requested resolution) to be part of the region.  Therefore,
      a more accurate answer can be sought by refining those triangles whose
      vertices include both positive and negative values.
    </p>

    <p>
      This results in a refined "shoreline" around the positive triangles.
      The function is evaluated at the new nodes, and again the negative triangles
      are dropped, the positive ones kept, and the intermediate triangles can
      be further refined, if desired.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also possible to estimate the integral of some function g(x,y)
      over the region implicitly defined by 0 <= f(x,y).
