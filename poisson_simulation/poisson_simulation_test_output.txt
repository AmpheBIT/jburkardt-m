POISSON_SIMULATION_TEST
  MATLAB version.
  Test the POISSON_SIMULATION library.

POISSON_SIMULATION_TEST01:
  POISSON_FIXED_EVENTS simulates a Poisson process
  until a given number of events have occurred.

  Simulate a Poisson process, for which, on average,
  LAMBDA events occur per unit time.
  Run until you have observed EVENT_NUM events.

  LAMBDA = 0.5
  EVENT_NUM = 1000

  Minimum wait = 0.00135221
  Average wait = 2.04634
  Maximum wait = 15.2321

 Count            Time            Wait

POISSON_SIMULATION_TEST02:
  POISSON_FIXED_EVENTS simulates a Poisson process
  counting the number of events that occur during
  a given time.

  Simulate a Poisson process, for which, on average,
  LAMBDA events occur per unit time.
  Run for a total of 1000 time units.
  LAMBDA = 0.5

  Mean number of events = 501.097
  Variance = 500.595,  STD = 22.374

  Normal end of execution.
