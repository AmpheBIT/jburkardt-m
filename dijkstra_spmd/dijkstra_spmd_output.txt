DIJKSTRA
  MATLAB version
  Use Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the minimum
  distance from node 1 to each node in a graph,
  given the distances between each pair of nodes.

  Distance matrix:

    0   40   15  Inf  Inf  Inf
   40    0   20   10   25    6
   15   20    0  100  Inf  Inf
  Inf   10  100    0  Inf  Inf
  Inf   25  Inf  Inf    0    8
  Inf    6  Inf  Inf    8    0

Lab 1:
  Worker 1 has nodes S = 1 to E = 2
Lab 2:
  Worker 2 has nodes S = 3 to E = 3
Lab 3:
  Worker 3 has nodes S = 4 to E = 5
Lab 4:
  Worker 4 has nodes S = 6 to E = 6
Adding node 3
Adding node 2
Adding node 6
Adding node 4
Adding node 5

  Minimum distances from node 1:

   1   0
   2  35
   3  15
   4  45
   5  49
   6  41
