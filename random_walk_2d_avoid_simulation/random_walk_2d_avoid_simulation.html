      RANDOM_WALK_2D_AVOID_SIMULATION <br> Simulation of a Self-Avoiding Random Walk in a 2D Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RANDOM_WALK_2D_AVOID_SIMULATION</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      simulates a self-avoiding random walk in a 2D region.
    </p>

    <p>
      A random self-avoiding walk of length STEP_NUM in 2D can be generated 
      by generating a random walk in 2D and "hoping" it doesn't intersect itself.
      If the next step would cause an intersection, then the generation is terminated
      prematurely; to ensure that the self-avoiding random walks are selected uniformly,
      we have to just keep trying random walks this way and "hoping".
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <b>RANDOM_WALK_2D_AVOID_PLOT</b> plots the trajectories of one
      or more self-avoiding random walks.  The user gives a desired length STEP_NUM,
      and the program generates a random walk that either reaches STEP_NUM without
      self-intersection, or is terminated early to avoid intersection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <b>RANDOM_WALK_2D_AVOID_SIMULATION</b> plots averaged data for
      any number of self-avoiding random walks that each try to achieve 
      the same number of steps.  The data plotted includes the number of steps
      each walk reached before termination, and a least squares fit to the
      distance versus number of steps.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>random_walk_2d_avoid_plot</b> ( <i>step_num</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>step_num</i> is the number of steps to take.  100 might be
          a typical value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      After the walk is plotted, the user can hit RETURN to seek another
      walk of the same length, which will be plotted together with the
      previous walks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>random_walk_2d_avoid_simulation</b> ( <i>step_num</i>, <i>walk_num</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>step_num</i> is the number of steps to take.  100 might be
          a typical value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>walk_num</i> is the number of random walks to take.  The data
          that is plotted comes from the average over all these walks.
          100 might be a reasonable value to try.
        </li>
      </ul>
