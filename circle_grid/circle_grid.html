    <p>
      <b>CIRCLE_GRID</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      generates the grid points that lie inside a circle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library allows the user to define an arbitrary circle by
      choosing its radius and center.  The user also chooses N, the number
      of subintervals into which the horizontal radius line will be subdivided.
      It then returns the gridpoints defined by that choice.
