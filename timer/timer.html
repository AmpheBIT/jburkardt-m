      TIMER <br> Compute Elapsed Time
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TIMER</b> 
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which 
      compute the elapsed CPU time or wallclock time of a part of a calculation.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is that you want to
      determine the amount of CPU time taken by a piece of your code, so
      you write lines like this:
      <pre><tt>
        t_start = timer;

        ...some big calculation...

        t_stop = timer;

        fprintf ( 1, 'Elapsed CPU time = %f\n', t_stop - t_start );
      </pre></tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB includes a function <b>CPUTIME</b>, which returns
      the CPU time in seconds.  This represents the amount of computer time
      "used" by your program, and could be somewhat less than the elapsed
      wall clock time.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB includes a function <b>CLOCK</b> which returns the YMDHMS 
      date as a vector of six integers.  Two values of <b>CLOCK</b> can be 
      subtracted, and the difference, or elapsed "wall clock time",
      returned in seconds, by the function <b>ETIME</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB includes two functions <b>TIC</b> and <b>TOC</b>.  If <b>TIC</b>
      is called before something is to be timed, and <b>TOC</b> is called
      afterward, then <b>TOC</b> will either print the elapsed wallclock
      time if its value is not being copied to a variable, or return the 
      value of the elapsed wallclock time to a variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      To time an entire program, the simplest method to get the elapsed
      wallclock time is to call <b>tic</b> before you run the program
      and <b>toc</b> afterwards:
      <pre>
        tic
        my_program
        toc
      </pre>
      If <b>toc</b> is called without an output argument, it prints the elapsed time.
      or you can save the output from <b>toc</b> and print it yourself.
      <pre>
        tic
        my_program
        wtime = toc
        fprintf ( 1, '  MY_PROGRAM took %f seconds to run.\n', wtime );
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For parallel programming, the important thing to measure is the elapsed
      wallclock time.  This can be found by subtracting an initial reading of
      the wallclock time from a final one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OpenMP system provides a function used as follows:
      <pre>
        seconds = omp_get_wtime ( )
        operations to time;
        seconds = omp_get_wtime ( ) - seconds;
      </pre>
      while the MPI system provides a similar function used as:
      <pre>
        seconds = MPI_Wtime ( );
        operations;
        seconds = MPI_Wtime ( ) - seconds;
      </pre>
      and in MATLAB, wallclock time can be taken with "tic" and "toc":
      <pre>
        tic;
        operation;
        seconds = toc;
      </pre>
    </p>
