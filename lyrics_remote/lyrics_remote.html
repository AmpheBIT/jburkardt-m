      Remote Execution of a Parallel MATLAB Program
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LYRICS_REMOTE</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how to submit a parallel MATLAB program to run on a remote
      machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before remote submission of jobs is possible, you must have an account on
      the remote machine, and go through some steps to ensure that that machine
      and your desktop machine can communicate properly.  If you have not
      carried out these steps, refer to the document
      <i>"Notes on Enabling Remote Submission of MATLAB Jobs"</i> listed
      in the references below.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is an example of how parallel MATLAB can be used to set up a
      systolic array of workers, that is, a set of cooperating processes, for
      which the output of worker 1 goes to worker 2 for further processing, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>systtolicLyricsFilter.m</i> code uses a systolic array of three tasks
      to filter an audio file.  The original file, <i>mjam.wav</i>, has a song
      with a few spoken words (by Cleve Moler) superposed.  The filtered version
      removes the spoken words from the sound track.  This is an example from the
      MathWorks DC01 course on Parallel Processing.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Start up MATLAB on your desktop.
      Then, at the MATLAB prompt, type
      <blockquote>
        <b>systolic_local</b>
      </blockquote>
      to run the program locally, on your desktop machine, or
      <blockquote>
        <b>systolic_ithaca</b>
      </blockquote>
      to have the program sent to ITHACA for execution.
