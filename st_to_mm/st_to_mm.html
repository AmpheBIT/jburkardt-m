      Convert Sparse Matrix File from ST to MM Format
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ST_TO_MM</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads sparse matrix data from an ST (Sparse Triplet) file and
      writes it to an MM (Matrix Market) file.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>st_to_mm</b> ( <i>'file.st'</i>, <i>'file.mm'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'file.st'</i> is the Sparse Triplet file to be read;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'file.mm'</i> is the Matrix Market file to be created.
        </li>
      </ul>
