    <p>
      <b>PPLANE8</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      interactively displays the phase plane for a differential equation,
      by John Polking.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PPLANE8</b> is an interactive tool for studying planar autonomous
      systems of differential equations.  When the program is executed, a
      Setup window is opened.  The user may enter the differential
      equation and specify a display window using the interactive
      controls in the Setup window.  Up to 4 parameters may also be 
      specified.  In addition the user is give a choice of the type of 
      field displayed and the number of field points.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Proceed button is pressed on the Setup window, the 
      Display window is opened, and a field of the type requested is 
      displayed for the system.  When the mouse button is depressed in 
      the Display window, the solution to the system with that
      initial condition is calculated and plotted.
