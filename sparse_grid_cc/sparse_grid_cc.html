      SPARSE_GRID_CC <br> Sparse Grids Based on the Clenshaw Curtis Rule
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_CC</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      can be used to compute the points and weights of a Smolyak sparse
      grid, based on a 1-dimensional Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule,
      to be used for efficient and accurate quadrature in multiple dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      One way of looking at the construction of sparse grids is to assume
      that we start out by constructing a (very dense) product grid.
      We will assume for now that the <b>order</b>, that is, the number of
      points used in each component grid, is the same for all dimensions.
      Moreover, we will assume that the order is a power of 2 plus one,
      so that we have a natural relationship between the order and
      the logarithm base 2 of the order minus 1:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><b>
        order = 2<sup>level</sup> + 1
      </b></pre>
      except that for the special case of <b>level=0</b> we assign
      <b>order=1</b>.  (If we used our formula, then this case would
      give us <b>order=2</b> instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, if we allow <b>level</b> to grow, the <b>order</b> roughly
      doubles, as follows:
      <table border = "1">
        <tr><th>Level</th><th>Order</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    0</td><td>    1</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    1</td><td>    3</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    2</td><td>    5</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    3</td><td>    9</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    4</td><td>   17</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    5</td><td>   33</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    6</td><td>   65</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    7</td><td>  129</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    8</td><td>  257</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    9</td><td>  513</th></tr>
        <tr><td>   10</td><td> 1025</th></tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep things simple, let us begin by supposing we are selecting
      points for a grid to be used in an interpolation or quadrature rule.
      If you successively compute the locations of the points of each
      level, you will probably see that the points of a level
      are all included in the grid associated with the next level.
      (This is not guaranteed for all rules; it's simply a property
      of the way most such grids are defined!).
    </p>

    <p>
      This <b>nesting</b> property is very useful.  For one thing,
      it means that when if we've computed a grid of one level, and now
      proceed to the next, then all the information associated with
      the current level (point location, the value of functions at those
      points) is still useful for the next level, and will save us
      some computation time as well.  This also means that, when we
      have reached a particular level, all the previous levels are
      still available to us, with no extra storage.  These considerations
      make it possible, for instance, to do efficient and convenient
      error estimation.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we move to a problem whose geometry is two-dimensional or
      more, we can still take the same approach.  However, when working
      in multidimensional geometry, it is usually not a good idea to
      form a grid using the product of 1D grids, especially when we
      are determining the order using the idea of levels.  Especially
      in this case, if we go to the next level in each dimension, the
      total number of points would increase by a factor of roughly
      2 to the spatial dimension.  Just a few such steps in, say,
      6 dimensions, and we would be far beyond our computational capacity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, in multidimensions, the idea is to construct a <i>sparse
      grid</i>, which can be thought of in one of two ways:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the sparse gird is a logical sum of low order product grids;
          each product grid has a total level (sum of the levels of the
          1d rules) that is less than or equal to <b>level_max</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          the sparse grid is a very sparse selection of points from the
          very high order product grid formed by using rules of level
          <b>level_max</b> in each dimension.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><i>
      (There is still a lot of explaining to do to get from the one-dimensional
      levels to the N-dimensional levels and the selection of the low-level
      product grids that sum up to the sparse grid...)
    </i></p>

    <p>
      Once the grid indices of the sparse grid points have been selected,
      there are a variety of schemes for distributing the points.  We
      consider closed quadrature rules, in which the endpoints of the
      interval are included.  The uniform scheme, known as the
      Newton Cotes Closed rule, is easy to understand.
      However, it has been observed that greater accuracy and stability
      can be achieved by arranging the points in a nonuniform way that tends
      to move points towards the boundary and away from the center.
      A common scheme for doing this starts with the uniform points on
      [0,1] and applies the cosine function to arrive at nonuniformly
      spaced points in [-1,1].  This scheme is known as the
      Clenshaw Curtis rule.
    <p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Newton Cotes Closed: <br>
          Points = [ 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1 ] / (N-1);<br>
          Uniformly spaced points on [0,1], including endpoints.<br>
          Point spacing is 1/(N-1).
        </li>
        <li>
          Clenshaw Curtis:<br>
          Theta = pi * [ 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1 ] / (N-1);<br>
          Points = cos ( Theta );<br>
          Nonuniformly spaced points on [-1,1], including endpoints.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The library of routines presented here will only construct grids
      based on the Clenshaw Curtis rule.
