      IMAGE_DENOISE <br> Remove Noise from an Image
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_DENOISE</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the median filter to try to remove noise from an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      In MATLAB, a black and white or gray scale image can be represented
      using a 2D array of nonnegative integers over some range 0 to GMAX.
      The value 0 indicates black, and GMAX white.  Intermediate values
      represent shades of gray in a natural way.  Note, however, that
      the eye has a nonlinear response to intensity, so that the value
      GMAX/2 will not be perceived as halfway between 0 and GMAX.  That
      is a separate issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      A color image can be represented using a set of three 2D arrays,
      which can be thought of as R, G, and B, and which represent the
      intensity of the red, green and blue signals that combine to
      form the color image.  A common maximum value is assumed, RGBMAX.
    </p>

    <p>
      An image can be read into MATLAB using the <b>imread</b> function
      in the Image Processing Toolbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example considered here, a good image is damaged by the addition of
      "salt and pepper" noise; that is, a scattering of individual pixels have
      been randomly reset to the lowest or highest possible values.  In a
      gray scale picture, such noise looks as though salt and pepper were
      added to the picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image src = "balloons_noisy.png" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240
      ALT="A Noisy Image">
    </p>

    <p>
      Since an image is fairly "smooth", each good pixel should actually be
      fairly close to the values of good pixels nearby, while this will not
      be true for the salt and pepper pixels.  So one way to make the noise
      go away, at the cost of some minor blurring, is to replace each pixel
      by the median value of itself and its neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB provides a command <b>medfilt2</b> which will do this, with
      the user allowed to specify the shape of a rectangular neighborhood
      about each pixel.  However, in this example, we go through some of
      the lower level details "by hand", using finally the <b>median</b>
      command to get what we want.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along the way, it should become clear how to deal with grayscale
      and RGB images.  Moreover, some other issues arise, such as ensuring
      that the processed data retains the "unsigned 8-bit integer" property
      of the original data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The functions <b>image_denoise_gray_news</b> and
      <b>image_denoise_rgb_news</b> use the central pixel and its
      north, east, west and south neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The functions <b>image_denoise_gray_3x3</b> and
      <b>image_denoise_rgb_3x3</b> use the central pixel and the entire
      layer of 8 pixels that lie at most one pixel away in the
      north/south and east/west directions.
