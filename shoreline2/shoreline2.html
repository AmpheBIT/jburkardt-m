      SHORELINE2 <br> Identify and Triangulate the Domain where F(X,Y) = C
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SHORELINE2</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      tries to identify and triangulate the approximate 2D domain over which 
      F(X,Y) = C for some user specified function F.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program begins with a given rectangular domain, within which all 
      the investigation is confined.  A set of points is generated within the
      domain and triangulated.  Then the function is evaluated at the points. 
      Triangles are dropped from the triangulation if all 3 vertices 
      have the same sign for F(X,Y)-C.  Triangles whose vertices have conflicting sign
      are saved for further study.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each triangle is now divided into four subtriangles, using the natural
      splitting involving the midpoints.  The function is evalluated at these
      midpoints, and all subtriangles with vertices of matching sign are again
      discarded.
    </p>

    <p>
      This process may be repeated several times.  In general, each step of the
      process is expected to produce a refined estimate of the region where f(x,y)=0,
      using about twice as many triangles, each of 1/4 the area of the previous 
      triangulation.
