fact_test

FACT_TEST
  Demonstrate a simple use of the MEX compiler,
  which allows MATLAB to call C functions.

  Get a directory listing.  The file FACT.C should be there.

.            ..           fact.c       fact_test.m  


  Compile the file FACT.C.

  Get a directory listing.  A new file should show up,
  containing the compiled information.

.            ..           fact.c       fact.dll     fact_test.m  


  Now use FACT as though it were a MATLAB M-file function.
