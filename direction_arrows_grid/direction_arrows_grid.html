      Uniform Grid from Scattered Data

    <p>
      <b>DIRECTION_ARROWS_GRID</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads velocity
      data defined at possibly scattered points, and creates a
      vector direction plot on a uniform grid of user-specified density.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is mainly a preprocessor for MATLAB's <b>quiver</b>
      routine.  It reads the (X,Y) coordinates of a set of points from
      a "node" file, and the corresponding horizontal and vertical velocities
      from a "velocity" file.  It uses MATLAB's <b>griddata</b> facility
      to create an interpolatory function to the given data.
      The interpolated function is then sampled on a regular grid.
      The velocities are divided by their norms to produce velocity
      directions, and then displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is especially useful if simply displaying the original
      data is unsuitable, perhaps because there are too many points, or
      too few, or because the density of points varies greatly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both the node and velocity files are simple "table" files whose
      format is described online.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program was written as a quick and convenient way to
      view finite element data.  It can also be used for any situation
      in which a collection of points and velocities are available.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, a small "sin" is committed when we use this program
      on finite element data, since we take only the node locations
      and velocities, but not the elements.  We simply use MATLAB's grid
      data feature which constructs a cubic spline interpolant to
      scattered data.  This is OK, and probably doesn't distort the
      data too much, but in fact, we are not actually viewing
      values of the finite element function, and there is no guarantee
      that this surrogate function will actually satisfy the boundary
      conditions or other characteristics of the finite element
      function.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>DIRECTION_ARROWS_GRID</b> is based in part on a plotting routine
      written by Professor Hyung-Chun Lee of Ajou University, Korea.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The calling sequence is:
      <blockquote><b>
        direction_arrows_grid ( node_file, velocity_file, scale, number )
      </b></blockquote>
      where
      <dl>
        <dt>
          node_file
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the name of the node file, which must be a quoted string;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          velocity_file
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the name of the velocity file, which must be a quoted string;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          scale
        </dt>
        <dd>
          a scale factor for the direction vectors;  A value of 1.0
          is reasonable.  A value of 0.0 results in automatic scaling.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          number
        </dt>
        <dd>
          the number of vectors to draw in one direction.  This is
          actually the number that will appear in the <i>longest</i>
          dimension of the region.  A value of 10 is reasonable to start
          with, which would result in 100 vectors if your region happens
          to be a square.
