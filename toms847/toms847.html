      SPINTERP <br> Piecewise multilinear hierarchical sparse grid interpolation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TOMS847</b>
      is a MATLAB library which 
      can determine points defining a sparse grid in a multidimensional
      space, and given specific values at those points, can construct
      an interpolating function that can be evaluated anywhere.
      This library is commonly known as SPINTERP.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sparse grid is constructed using Smolyak's construction.  In fact,
      a nested series of grids is defined, each a refinement of the previous
      one, but chosen in such a way that the typical exponential growth
      in order does not occur.  Moreover, because the grids are nested,
      the procedure produces a hierarchical series of piecewise linear
      interpolants.  The nesting of these interpolants allows the estimation
      of the interpolation error.
    </p>

    <p>
      The package includes several choices for the underlying one dimensional
      rule used to construct the sparse grids.  The recommended rule is
      a Newton Cotes Closed rule, which produces grids of uniformly spaced 
      points in [0,1], including the endpoints, of orders 1, 3, 5, 9,
      17, 33, 65, and in general (2^I)+1.  Note that the first rule is
      a special case (it doesn't include the endpoints, and the number
      of points in the rule is not equal to (2^0)+1!).  Also note that
      the authors denote this rule as the "Clenshaw Curtis" or "CC" rule,
      although that name is more properly associated with the grid obtained by
      taking the cosine of the points given by the Newton Cotes Closed rule!
    </p>

    <p>
      Another 1D rule is denoted by the authors as the "NB" or "no boundary"
      rule.  This is simply a Newton Cotes Open rule which produces grids 
      of uniformly spaced points in [0,1], omitting the endpoints, 
      of orders 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, and in general (2^(I+1))-1. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Another 1D rule is denoted by the authors as the "M" or "maximum norm"
      rule.  This rule is the same as the CC rule, except that it starts
      with the rule of order 3.  This seemingly minor difference forces
      this rule to use many more points than the other rules in the
      multidimensional case.  The difference is evident in 2 dimensions,
      and quickly overwhelming even in dimensions as low as 4!
