    <p>
      <b>DIRECTION_ARROWS_SEQUENCE</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      makes
      velocity direction arrow plots using a single XY coordinate file,
      and a sequence of UV velocity datasets, stored as TABLE files
      (except that no "#" comment lines are allowed).
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is mainly a preprocessor for MATLAB's <b>quiver</b>
      routine.  It reads the (X,Y) coordinates of a set of points from an
      "XY" file, and the corresponding horizontal and vertical velocities
      from a "UV" file.
    </p>

    <p>
      It then makes a few settings, computes the
      direction field from the velocity field, calls <b>quiver</b>
      to plot the arrows, and also traces out the convex hull of the points,
      which is presumably the boundary of the region.  The resulting
      image is displayed, and saved to a PNG file.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the program assumes that the user actually has a
      sequence of UV datasets, with "consecutive" names, each of which
      is to be plotted.  The program automatically reads each such
      dataset and creates the sequence of PNG files.
      It is easy to
      take such a sequence and make an animation.
