      GRID_DISPLAY <br> Plot 1D, 2D and 3D Point Grids
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>GRID_DISPLAY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      can read an ASCII file defining a set of points on a 1D, 2D or 3D grid 
      or sparse grid, and display a plot of those points,
      inside a plot frame of user-specified range
      <b>[Rmin,Rmax]</b>.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>grid_display</b> ( <i>'file_name'</i>, <i>rmin</i>, <i>rmax</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'file_name'</i> is the name of the file containing the data points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>rmin, rmax</i> is the range in X, Y (and possibly Z) over which the plot 
          is to be displayed.  This is typically either [-1,1] or [0,1].  
          Some grids don't
          include points on the boundary, so it is useful to be able to 
          specify the plot range, and thus force the boundaries to show up,
          and to show up "in the same place" for multiple plots.  Also,
          this feature allows you to zoom in on part of the grid, if you wish.
        </li>
      </ul>
