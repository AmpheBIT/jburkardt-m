      MM_TO_HB <br> Matrix Market Sparse Matrix File to Harwell Boeing Sparse Matrix File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MM_TO_HB</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which
      reads the information stored in a Matrix Market file, and writes it to a
      corresponding Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix file.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is conceivable that the Matrix Market file will include (unnecessary)
      information associated with zero entries of the matrix.  <b>MM_TO_HB</b>
      will automatically drop such information from the Harwell-Boeing file
      that it creates.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>mm_to_hb</b> ( <i>'input.mm'</i>, <i>'output.hb'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'input.mm'</i> is the Matrix Market file to be read;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'output.hb'</i> is the Harwell-Boeing file to be created;
