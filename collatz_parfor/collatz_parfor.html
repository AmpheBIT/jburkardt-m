      COLLATZ_PARFOR <br> A Parallel MATLAB Function Using PARFOR
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COLLATZ_PARFOR</b>
      is a directory which
      illustrates how a MATLAB function using the PARFOR statement
      can be run in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Collatz sequence starting at the integer I computes the next term
      by halving the number if it is even, or tripling and adding 1 if it is odd.
      The sequence stops when the value 1 is reached.
    </p>

    <p>
      The number of steps required to reach 1 varies greatly.  No formula
      has been determined, and in fact, it hasn't actually been proved that
      the value of 1 will always be reached.
    </p>

    <p>
      An interesting question, suitable for parallel execution, is to ask for
      the length of the longest Collatz sequence between 1 and N.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the VT Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The basic calculation is done by <b>collatz_fun</b> and has the form:
      <blockquote>
        <i>j_max</i> = <b>collatz_fun</b> ( <i>n</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>n</i> is the largest integer to check.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>j_max</i> is the longest sequence encountered.
        </li>
      </ul>
