      Examples of MATLAB calling the Computer Operating System (OS)
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_OS</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which 
      illustrate how to issue a command to the computer operating system (OS),
      and collect the results.  This is one way that, for instance,
      MATLAB can continue running, but start up an external
      executable program that carries out some useful task.  For
      example, MATLAB might create a file, the program might modify it,
      and MATLAB might use the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      The call to the operating system has the form
      <blockquote><b>
        [ status, string ] = system ( command )
      </b></blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>command</b> is a quoted string representing a command
          to the computer operating system, such as <br>
          <i>'who'</i> or <br>
          <i>'sort mydata.txt > sorted.txt'</i> or <br>
          <i>'myprog < input > output'</i> <br> 
          where, presumably, <i>myprog</i> is a user program that
          is in the current path.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>status</b> is output as 0 if the command was executed successfully,
          (that is, there was such a command, and it ran without errors),
          and nonzero otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>string</b> is a string containing the printed output from 
          the command, if it ran successfully.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, while running MATLAB, a UNIX user might issue the command
      <blockquote><b>
        [ status, string ] = system ( 'who' );
      </b></blockquote>
      and a Microsoft Windows user might issue the command
      <blockquote><b>
        [ status, string ] = system ( 'dir' );
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      On a Unix system, the user may use the <b>unix</b> command, and on
      a PC running Windows, the <b>dos</b> command may be issued.  In the
      case of a <b>dos</b> command, it may be useful to terminate 
      the quoted string with an ampersand, in which case the console
      will open in a separate window.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the status and printed output of the system command are of no
      interest, it is possible to run the command simply using the
      exclamation mark followed by the command.  It is not necessary in
      this case to put quotes around the command. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, while running MATLAB, a UNIX user might issue the command
      <blockquote><b>
        ! who
      </b></blockquote>
      and a Microsoft Windows user might issue the command
      <blockquote><b>
        ! dir
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since a user's compiled program can be treated as another system
      command, a MATLAB user might want to run the program <b>a.out</b>
      while pausing (but not terminating) the MATLAB session.  In this
      way, the <b>a.out</b> program might be able to read files that
      MATLAB produced, and produce new files that the MATLAB user will 
      need.  If the program <b>a.out</b> is in the right place, the
      command might be as simple as
      <blockquote><b>
        [ status, string ] = system ( 'a.out' );
      </b></blockquote>
      or, perhaps
      <blockquote><b>
        ! a.out
      </b></blockquote>
      or, if input and output files need to be named:
      <blockquote><b>
        [ status, string ] = system ( 'a.out &lt; input &gt; output' );
      </b></blockquote>
      or, perhaps
      <blockquote><b>
        ! a.out &lt; input &gt; output
      </b></blockquote>
