    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_DIFFUSE</b>
      is a MATLAB function which
      uses diffusion to smooth the colors in a picture.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        function <i>g2</i> = <b>image_diffuse</b> ( <i>g</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>k</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>g</i> is an <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> <b>uint8</b>
          (short integers, 0 to 255) array containing the grayscale image data;
          MATLAB's <b>imread()</b> command can be used to create such a
          dataset from a graphics image file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>c</i> is a value, typically between 0 and 1, which controls the
          diffusion.  C = 0 means the picture is unchanged.  C = 1 means each
          pixel is completely replaced by a neighborhood average.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>k</i> indicates the number of steps of diffusion to carry out.
          After k steps, a single black pixel will be diffused with pixels
          up to k pixels away in all directions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>g2</i> is an <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> <b>uint8</b>
          array containing the diffused version of the image.
        </li>
      </ul>
