ODE_BATCH_LOCAL:
  Run ODE_SCRIPT locally.

ODE_SCRIPT
  Sweep through sets of values of parameters B and K,
  computing the solution of the ODE corresponding to each set.
  For each solution X(T), determine the maximum value over time.
  Construct a contour plot of XMAX(B,K).
  Use the PARFOR command to carry out these computations in parallel.

  Number of K values = 71
  Number of B values = 99
  Number of times the ODE must be solved = 7029
