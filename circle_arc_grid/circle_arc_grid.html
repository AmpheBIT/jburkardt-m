      <b>ARC</b> is a set of 10 equally spaced points from 0 to 90 degrees,
      on a circle of radius 2 centered at (5,5).
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "arc.txt">arc.txt</a>, the data.

          <a href = "arc.png">arc.png</a>, an image of the points.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PENTAGON</b> is a set of 6(!) equally spaced points from 0 to
      360 degrees.  This is the easiest way to get a pentagon, but
      you should really edit the file and remove the last point, since
      it repeats the first one.  The alternative is to specify that
      the angles range from 0 to 288 degrees!
