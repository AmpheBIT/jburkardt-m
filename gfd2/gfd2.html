    <p>
      <b>GFD2</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      contains many functions for geophysical fluid dynamics.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The MATLAB functions are intended to illustrate the ideas in the
      textbook <i>Introduction to Geophysical Fluid Dynamics</i> by 
      Benoit Cushman-Roisin and Jean-Marie Beckers.

      Source Code:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The source codes are listed by the chapter of the book in which they are
      discussed.  A few codes are mentioned in several chapters, and so are
      listed here several times.  The codes are either <i>scripts</i> or
      <i>functions</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <i>script</i> is a sequence of MATLAB commands
      that can be run by invoking the name of the script.  Thus, if you are
      running MATLAB, you can type <b>coriolisdis</b> and know that something
      will happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <i>function</i> is a sequence of MATLAB commands that require some
      input values from the user, and return some output values.  Thus, to
      use the function, you need to know what goes in and comes out, and 
      supply the appropriate input.  To use <b>aliasanim</b>, for instance,
      you might type
      <pre>
        n = 300;
        nper = 2;
        aliasanim ( n, nper ) 
      </pre>
      (This function just draws a picture, so there's no output.)
