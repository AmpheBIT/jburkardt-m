    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_HISTOGRAM</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      computes the number of points from a dataset that are contained in
      each triangle of a triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      One application of this program is simply to determine whether the dataset
      represents an approximately uniform sampling of the region covered by
      the triangulation.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangulation_histogram</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i>, <i>'data_filename'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where <i>'prefix'</i> is the common prefix for the node and element files
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,    the node coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>_elements.txt</b>,    the element definitions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      and
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'data_filename'</i> is the name of the file containing the data points.
