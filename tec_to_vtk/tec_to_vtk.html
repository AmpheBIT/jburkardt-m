      TEC_TO_VTK <br> Convert a (particular) TECPLOT File to a set of VTK files
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TEC_TO_VTK</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      reads a TECPLOT graphics
      file containing 80 images of the motion and deformation of a red blood cell,
      and outputs 80 separate VTK unstructured grid files, which can be read into
      PARAVIEW and animated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program was written to handle a single specific file.  Some parts of the
      program might be useful for someone needing a similar kind of translation.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>tec_to_vtk</b> ( )
      </blockquote>
      expects to read the TECPLOT ASCII file 'rbc.dat' and 
      creates 'rbc_001.vtk' through 'rbc_080.vtk'.

    <p>
      <b>RBC</b> is data defining 80 "snapshots" of the motion and deformation
      of a red blood cell.  This data was originally stored in a TECPLOT file.
      The tec_to_vtk program extracted 80 VTK files, and PARAVIEW turned that
      into an animation.  (Actually, PARAVIEW turned it into an AVI animation
      which my bonehead copy of QUICKTIME couldn't decode, so I had to idiotize
      myself, and have PARAVIEW create 80 JPEG files, which QUICKTIME was then
      able to turn into a MOV file.  Soon everything will be possible and 
      nothing will work...)
