LCVT_DATASET (MATLAB version)
  Generate a Latinized CVT dataset.

  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * SEED_INIT, a seed to use for random number generation,
  * INIT, initialize the points:
    ** file, read data from a file;
    ** 'GRID', by picking points from a grid;
    ** 'HALTON', from a Halton sequence;
    ** 'RAND', using MATLAB's RAND function;
    ** 'UNIFORM', using a simple uniform RNG;
    ** 'USER', refers to the USER routine;
  * CVT_IT_NUM, the number of CVT iterations.
  * SAMPLE, how to conduct the sampling.
    ** 'GRID', by picking points from a grid;
    ** 'HALTON', from a Halton sequence;
    ** 'RAND', using MATLAB's RAND function;
    ** 'UNIFORM', using a simple uniform RNG;
    ** 'USER', refers to the USER routine;
  * SAMPLE_NUM, the number of sample points;
  * BATCH, the number of sample points to create at a time;
  * LAT_IT_NUM, the number of Latinizing iterations.
  * OUTPUT, a file into which the data is stored.

  To indicate that no further computations are 
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value, 
  such as -1.

  DIM_NUM is the spatial dimension.
  (Try '2' if you have no preference.)
  (Any value less than 1 terminates execution.)
  Enter DIM_NUM:  2
  User input DIM_NUM =            2

  N is the number of points to generate.
  (Try '25' if you have no preference.)
  (Any value less than 1 terminates execution.)
  Enter N:  85
  User input N =           85

  SEED_INIT is a seed for the random number generation.
  (Try '123456789' if you have no preference.)
  (Any value less than 0 terminates execution.)
  Enter SEED_INIT:  123456789
  User input SEED_INIT = 123456789

  INIT is the method of initializing the data:

  file       read data from a file;
  'GRID'     by picking points from a grid;
  'HALTON'   from a Halton sequence;
  'RAND'     using MATLAB's RAND function;
  'UNIFORM'  using a simple uniform RNG;
  'USER'     refers to the USER routine;
 
  (Try 'RAND' if you have no preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
  (Be sure to INCLUDE QUOTES around the string!
 
  Enter INIT:  'UNIFORM'
  User input INIT = "UNIFORM".

  CVT_IT_NUM is the number of CVT iterations.

  A CVT iteration carries out the following steps:
  * the Voronoi region associated with each
    generator is estimated by sampling;
  * the centroid of each Voronoi region is estimated.
  * the generator is replaced by the centroid.

  If "enough" sampling points are used,
  and "enough" iterations are taken, this process
  will converge.

  (Try '50' if you have no preference.)
  (A negative value terminates execution).

  Enter CVT_IT_NUM:  40
  User input CVT_IT_NUM =           40

  SAMPLE is the method of sampling the region:

  'GRID'     by picking points from a grid;
  'HALTON'   from a Halton sequence;
  'RAND'     using MATLAB's RAND function;
  'UNIFORM'  using a simple uniform RNG;
  'USER'     refers to the USER routine;

  (Try 'RAND' if you have no preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
  (Be sure to INCLUDE QUOTES around the string!

  Enter SAMPLE:  'UNIFORM'
  User input SAMPLE = "UNIFORM".

  SAMPLE_NUM is the number of sample points.

  The Voronoi regions will be explored by generating
  SAMPLE_NUM points.  For each sample point, the
  nearest generator is found.  Using more points
  gives a better estimate of these regions.

  SAMPLE_NUM should be much larger than N, the
  number of generators.

  (Try '10000' if you have no preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)

  Enter SAMPLE_NUM:  10000
  User input SAMPLE_NUM =        10000

  BATCH is the number of sample points to create
  at one time

  BATCH should be between 1 and SAMPLE_NUM.

  It is FASTER to set BATCH to SAMPLE_NUM;
  setting BATCH to 1 requires the least memory.

  (Try '1000' if you have no preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)

  Enter BATCH:  1000
  User input BATCH = 1000

  LAT_IT_NUM is the number of Latinizing iterations.

  Each step of the latinizing iteration begins
  by carrying out CVT_IT_NUM steps of CVT iteration,
  after which the data is "latinized".

  Often, one latinizing step is enough.

  In some cases, it may be worth while to carry
  out several latinizing steps; that is, the
  Latinized data is smoothed by another series
  of CVT steps, then latinized, and so on.

  (Try '1' if you have no preference.)
  (A negative value terminates execution).

  Enter LAT_IT_NUM:  5
  User input LAT_IT_NUM =            5

  OUTPUT is a file into which the data is stored;

  (Try 'lcvt.txt' if you have no preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).
  (Be sure to INCLUDE QUOTES around the string!
 
  Enter OUTPUT:  'lcvt01.txt'
  User input OUTPUT = "lcvt01.txt".
