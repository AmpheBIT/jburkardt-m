      Display 3D Points and Lines in the MATLAB Graphics Window
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>XYZL_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads XYZL information
      containing a list of 3D point coordinates, and the indices of points
      that form lines, and displays a plot in the MATLAB graphics window.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program SXYZ_DELAUNAY, which creates a Delaunay triangulation on
      a sphere, is an example of a program whose output is in the form
      that this program can display.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>xyzl_display</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i> is the common file prefix.
        </li>
      </ul>
      reads the point coordinate data in <i>'prefix.xyz'</i> and
      the line information in <i>'prefix.xyzl'</i>, and displays a plot.
