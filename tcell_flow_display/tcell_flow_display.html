      <b>TCELL_FLOW_DISPLAY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      can display a snapshot of the velocity field from a dataset of solutions of a
      time-dependent incompressible parameterized flow problem in a 
      T-cell.

      The "T-Cell" region is a T-shaped region contained in a subset
      of the unit square [01]x[01].  The top half of the region is a
      channel open to the left and right, with a rectangular recess in 
      the bottom.  The left channel opening extends from [0.0,0.5] to
      [0.0,1.0], and the right channel from [1.0,0.5] to [1.0,1.0].
      The recess is a square, whose bottom extends from [0.25,0.0] to
      [0.75,0.0], and which extends upward to meet the channel.

      The grid can be thought of as being generated by a uniform 81 by 81 
      uniformly spaced grid of nodes, from which the nodes corresponding to
      the two voids have been deleted.  This leaves 4,961 nodes.
      These nodes are organized into 2400 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure.
