      SPARSE_GRID_COMPOSITE <br> Sparse Grids Based on 1D Composite Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_COMPOSITE</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      can be used to compute the points and weights of a Smolyak sparse
      grid, based on a 1-dimensional composite quadrature rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, the library only allows composite rules of the 1 point
      midpoint formula.  A 1D composite rule of the midpoint rule is suitable
      for integration of functions with low or variable smoothness.  A sparse
      grid formed from such rules can better handle multidimensional integrands
      with limited smoothness.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, for both the 1D composite rule
      and the sparse grid rule, the repeated use of the midpoint rule limits
      the order of accuracy of the quadrature; therefore, if the integrand is
      known to be of higher smoothness, other approaches will produce an
      accurate answer more quickly.
