    <p>
      <b>DIRECTION_ARROWS</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      makes an arrow plot 
      of a velocity direction field, using XY and UV data stored as 
      <a href = "../../data/table/table.html">TABLE files</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is mainly a preprocessor for MATLAB's <b>quiver</b>
      routine.  It reads the (X,Y) coordinates of a set of points from an
      "XY" file, and the corresponding horizontal and vertical velocities
      from a "UV" file.  It then makes a few settings, computes the
      direction field from the velocity field, calls <b>quiver</b>
      to plot the arrows, and also traces out the convex hull of the points,
      which is presumably the boundary of the region.
