SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_TEST:
  MATLAB version
  Test the SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH library.

SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_TEST01
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH maps from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_INVERSE is the inverse map.
  Check that these two functions are inverses.

  Map points from sphere to plane to sphere.
  Maximum difference for 100 points was 0.000000

  Map points from plane to sphere to plane.
  Maximum difference for 100 points was 0.000000

SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_TEST02
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH standard mapping from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2 generalized mapping:
  (focus and center are arbitrary)
  Check that these two functions can agree.

  Map points from sphere to plane.
  Maximum difference for 100 points was 0.000000

  Map points from plane to sphere.
  Maximum difference for 100 points was 0.000000

SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_TEST03
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2 maps from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2_INVERSE is the inverse map.
  Check that these two functions are inverses.

  Using radius = 0.996643
  center = (0.561695,0.415307,0.066119)
  focus =  (0.218418,0.956318,0.829509)

  Map points from sphere to plane to sphere.
  Maximum difference for 100 points was 0.000000

  Map points from plane to sphere to plane.
  Maximum difference for 100 points was 0.000000

SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
