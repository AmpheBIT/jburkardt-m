      FEM2D_HEAT_SPARSE <br>
      Finite Element Solution of the Heat Equation <br>
      on a Triangulated Region <br>
      using MATLAB's Sparse Solver
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_HEAT_SPARSE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      applies the finite element method to solve
      a form of the time-dependent heat equation over an arbitrary
      triangulated region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The linear system is created and stored using
      MATLAB's sparse matrix storage.  The system is factored and solved
      by MATLAB, using sparse matrix solution techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is derived from a similar program, <b>FREE_FEM_HEAT</b>,
      which uses banded storage, factorization and solution methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      The geometry is entirely external to the program.  The user
      specifies one file of nodal coordinates, and one file that
      describes the triangles in terms of six node coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program makes a default assumption that all boundary conditions
      correspond to Dirichlet boundary conditions.  The user
      can adjust these boundary conditions (and even specify Dirichlet
      constraints on any variable at any node) by setting the appropriate
      data in certain user routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>At the moment, Neumann conditions, if specified, must have a
      zero right hand side.  The machinery to integrate a nonzero
      Neumann condition has not been set up yet.</i>
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      Computational Region
    </h2>

    <p>
      The computational region is initially unknown by the program.  The user
      specifies it by preparing a file containing the coordinates of
      the nodes, and a file containing the indices of nodes that make
      up triangles that form a triangulation of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, the user does not type in this information by hand, but has
      a program fill in the nodes, and perhaps another program that
      constructs the triangulation.  However, in the simplest case,
      the user might construct a very crude triangulation by hand, and
      have <a href = "../../f_src/triangulation_refine/triangulation_refine.html">
      TRIANGULATION_REFINE</a> refine it to something more reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the following ridiculously small example:
      <pre>
       10-11-12
        |\   |\
        | \  | \
        6  7 8  9
        |   \|   \
        1-2--3--4-5
      </pre>
      the node file would be:
      <pre>
         0.0  0.0
         1.0  0.0
         2.0  0.0
         3.0  0.0
         4.0  0.0
         0.0  1.0
         1.0  1.0
         2.0  1.0
         3.0  1.0
         0.0  2.0
         1.0  2.0
         2.0  2.0
      </pre>
      and the element file would be
      <pre>
         1  3 10  2  7  6
         3  5 12  4  9  8
        12 10  3 11  7  8
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is set up to handle the time dependent heat
      equation with a right hand side function, and nonhomogeneous
      Dirichlet boundary conditions.   The state variable
      U(T,X,Y) is then constrained by:
      <pre>
        Ut - ( Uxx + Uyy ) + K(x,y,t) * U = F(x,y,t)  in the region
                                        U = G(x,y,t)  on the boundary
                                        U = H(x,y,t)  at initial time TINIT.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To specify the right hand side function F(x,y,t), the linear
      coefficient K(x,y,t), the boundary condition function G(x,y,t),
      and the initial condition H(x,y,t),
      the user has to supply four functions,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION F = RHS ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b> evaluates the
          right hand side forcing term F(x,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION K = K_COEF ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b> evaluates K(x,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION G = DIRICHLET_CONDITION ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b>
          evaluates G(x,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION H = INITIAL_CONDITION ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b>
          evaluates H(x,y,t), and is only called for TIME = TINIT.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program writes out a file containing an Encapsulated
      PostScript image of the nodes and elements, with numbers.
      If there are too many nodes, the plot may be too cluttered
      to read.  For lower values, however, it is
      a valuable map of what is going on in the geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is also able to write out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To run the program, the user must write the user files
      described above, make all the files associated with
      <b>fem2d_heat_sparse</b> available in the same directory,
      or in the user's MATLAB path, and supply the names of
      the node and triangle files to the main program:
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>fem2d_heat_sparse</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where 'prefix' is the common input filename prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix_nodes.txt'</i> is the name of the node file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix_elements.txt'</i> is the name of the element file;
        </li>
      </ul>
