      QUAD_SPMD <br> SPMD (Single Program/Multiple Data) Quadrature
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUAD_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the <b>SPMD</b> (single program, multiple data) command to estimate
      an integral using quadrature.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>SPMD</b> command allows a programmer to set up parallel computations
      that require more user control than the simple <b>parfor</b> command.
      In particular, users familiar with MPI will see many features that are
      similar to that parallel programming model, including the ability to
      send and receive messages.  (Messages will NOT be exhibited in this
      simple example, however!)
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm carried out estimates the integral of a function f(x)
      from 0 to 1 by the trapezoidal rule:
      <pre>
        Integral ( a <= x <= b ) f(x) dx = ( b - a ) / ( 2 * ( n - 1 ) )
          * ( f(x1) + 2*f(x2) + 2*f(x3) + ... + 2*f(xn-2) + 2*f(xn-1) + f(xn) )
      </pre>
      where xi is the i-th point equally spaced between a and b, with the
      endpoints included.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's clear that this calculation can be done in parallel, and in fact,
      simply by defining appropriate values of ai and bi, we can have
      parallel process i carry out the trapezoidal rule over [ai,bi] and
      sum the results to get the answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example demonstrates how MATLAB's SPMD facility can be used to
      implement this parallel calculation.  No attempt is made to compare
      the timings of the parallel code to a sequential calculation.  The point
      here is simply the mechanics of setting up an SPMD calculation, and
      showing what you can expect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several points are worth mentioning:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Parallel sections of the code begin with the <b>spmd</b> statement,
          and end with an <b>end</b> statement.  The computations in these
          blocks occur on the MATLAB workers.  The client sits idly and "watches".
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>matlabpool</b> parameter of the <b>batch</b> command defines a number of workers.
          Each <b>spmd</b> block brings these workers into activity.
          Each worker has access to the variable <b>numlabs</b>, which
          contains the number of workers.  Each worker has a unique value
          of the variable <b>labindex</b>, between 1 and <b>numlabs</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any variable defined by the client is "visible" to the workers and
          can be used on the right hand side of equations within the <b>spmd</b> blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any variable defined by the workers is a "composite" variable.  If a variable
          called <b>X</b> is defined by the workers, then each worker has its own
          value, and the set of values is accessible by the client, using the worker's
          index.  Thus <b>X{1}</b> is the value of <b>X</b> computed by worker 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          A program can have several <b>spmd</b> blocks.  If the program completes
          an <b>spmd</b> block, carries out some commands in the client program,
          and then enters another <b>spmd</b> block, then all the variables defined
          during the previous <b>spmd</b> block still exist.  The data that was
          on worker 1 is still there, for instance.  It is simply as though
          each worker was "paused" while the client did some work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Workers cannot directly see each other's variables.  Communication from
          one worker to another can be done through the client.  However, a limited
          number of special operators are available, that can be used within
          <b>spmd</b> blocks, which combine variables.  In particular, the command
          <b>gplus</b> sums the values of a variable that exists on all the workers,
          and returns to each worker the value of that sum.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function value = quad_fun ( n )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          n, is the number of points to use;
        </li>
        <li>
          value, is the estimated integral.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
