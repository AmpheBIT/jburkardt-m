      BURGERS_SOLUTION <br> Exact Solution of Time Dependent 1D Viscous Burgers Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BURGERS_SOLUTION</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      evaluates an exact solution of the time-dependent 1D viscous Burgers equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The form of the Burgers equation considered here is:
      <pre>
        du       du        d^2 u
        -- + u * -- = nu * -----
        dt       dx        dx^2
      </pre>
      for -1.0 < x < +1.0, and 0.0 < t.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initial conditions are u(x,0) = - sin(pi*x).  Boundary conditions
      are u(-1,t) = u(+1,t) = 0.  The viscosity parameter nu is taken
      to be 0.01 / pi, although this is not essential.
    </p>

    <p>
      The authors note an integral representation for the solution u(x,t),
      and present a better version of the formula that is amenable to
      approximation using Hermite quadrature.  
    </p>

    <p>
      This program library does little more than evaluate the exact solution
      at a user-specified set of points, using the quadrature rule.
      Internally, the order of this quadrature rule is set to 8, but the
      user can easily modify this value if greater accuracy is desired.
    </p>
