      FD2D_HEAT_EXPLICIT_SPMD <br>
      Finite Difference 2D Heat Equation Using SPMD (Single Program/Multiple Data)
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD2D_HEAT_EXPLICIT_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the <b>SPMD</b> (single program, multiple data) command to estimate
      the time evolution of heat over a 2D region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>SPMD</b> command allows a programmer to set up parallel computations
      that require more user control than the simple <b>parfor</b> command.
      In particular, users familiar with MPI will see many features that are
      similar to that parallel programming model, including the ability to
      send and receive messages.  (Messages will NOT be exhibited in this
      simple example, however!)
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function y = heat2d_fun ( x )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          x, is a black and white image, which will be regarded as the initial condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          y, is a black and white image, which has endured 100 steps of blurring
          by application of the heat equation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the point here is to watch the evolution of the blurred pictures,
      this program has only been set up to run locally and interactively,
      using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
