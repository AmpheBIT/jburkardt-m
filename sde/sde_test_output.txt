SDE_TEST:
  MATLAB version.
  Test the SDE library.

BPATH
  Brownian path simulation
Elapsed time is 0.000032 seconds.

  Plot stored as "bpath.png"

BPATH_VECTORIZED
  Brownian path simulation
Elapsed time is 0.000031 seconds.

  Plot saved as "bpath_vectorized.png"

BPATH_AVERAGE
  Average 1000 Brownian path simulations.
Elapsed time is 0.023492 seconds.

  Plot saved as "bpath_average.png"

  Maximum error in averaged data is 0.024035

CHAIN
  Solve a stochastic differential equation involving a function
  of a stochastic variable X.
  We can solve for X(t), and then evaluate V(X(t)).
  Or, we can apply the stochastic chain rule to derive an
  an SDE for V, and solve that.

  Maximum difference = 0.00656882
