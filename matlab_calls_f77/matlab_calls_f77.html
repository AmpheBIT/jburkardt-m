      Examples of MATLAB calling FORTRAN77 functions
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_CALLS_F77</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how a MATLAB program can call a FORTRAN77 function,
      passing data to the function,
      and receiving results from the FORTRAN77 function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, a MATLAB call normally looks something like
      <blockquote><b>
        [ out1, out2 ] = function_name ( in1, in2, in3 )
      </b></blockquote>
      so in order to pass the information to and from MATLAB, the
      FORTRAN function is required to have a header like this:
      <blockquote><b>
        subroutine mexFunction ( nlhs, plhs, nrhs, prhs )
      </b></blockquote>
      where <b>nlhs</b> counts the number of output arguments, and
      <b>plhs</b> is an integer array of pointers to those arguments,
      with <b>nrhs</b> and <b>prhs</b> being the analogous quantities
      for the input arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user's FORTRAN file must have an INCLUDE statement at the very
      beginning of the file of the following form:
      <pre>
      # include <fintrf.h>
      </pre>
      This statement is handled by the FORTRAN preprocessor, and so the 
      FORTRAN file will probably need to have an extension of ".F" (that is, 
      CAPITAL F) to indicate that it requires preprocessing.  One of the
      things this include file does is to define a datatype called
      "mwpointer", which must be used to declare the arrays <b>plhs</b>
      and <b>prhs</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MATLAB Mex library includes a number of operators to extract
      information from the MATLAB input arguments, and to store the
      computed results into the output arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the F77 file is written, it must be "compiled" with the MATLAB
      MEX compiler, which will, as part of its work, also invoke some
      C compiler on your machine.  The first time you use the MEX compiler,
      you may need to tell it where the appropriate compiler is, or
      which compiler to use.  You can also, at any time, request that
      MEX switch to a different compiler, if there is a choice.  To
      choose or change your compiler, type (inside of MATLAB)
      <blockquote><b>
        mex -setup
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming your F77 file is called <i>fact.F</i>, for example, you
      can process it through the MEX compiler.  You can always issue
      this command inside of MATLAB, and on some systems, the MEX
      compiler may be availabe directly as an external command.
      In either case, you issue the command:
      <blockquote><b>
        mex fact.F
      </b></blockquote>
      which creates a compiled file whose name is system-dependent.  On
      a Windows PC, it might be called <b>fact.dll</b>, and on a UNIX
      system, it might be something like <b>fact.mexglx</b>.  In any case,
      the compiled file behaves essentially like a MATLAB M file called
      <b>fact.m</b> (except that it should, you hope, execute much faster
      than a MATLAB script).
    </p>

    <p>
      In the very likely event that you have problems compiling the code,
      or using it from MATLAB, you may want to request the verbose
      compilation, with symbolic information added for debugging:
      <blockquote><b>
        mex -v -g fact.F
      </b></blockquote>

      <b>FACT</b> is an example in which a FORTRAN77 function is used to
      compute the factorial function.  A single routine is used,
      which takes care of the "translation" between MATLAB and FORTRAN77,
      and the computation of the result.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "fact.F">fact.F</a>, the source code of the FORTRAN77
          function.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "fact_test.m">fact_test.m</a>, a MATLAB M file which
          compiles FORTRAN77 code and uses it.

        <li>
          <a href = "fact_test_output.txt">fact_test_output.txt</a>,

    <p>
      <b>CHEBY_U</b> is an example in which a FORTRAN77 function is used to
      compute the Chebyshev U polynomial.  The coding is done in such
      a way that the computation is in a separate FORTRAN77 function; the
      mexFunction is only used to "translate" between MATLAB and C.

        <li>
          <a href = "cheby_u.F">cheby_u.F</a>, the source code of the
          FORTRAN77 function.
