FACT_TEST
  MATLAB version
  Demonstrate a simple use of the MEX compiler,
  which allows MATLAB to call FORTRAN77 functions.

  Get a directory listing.  The file FACT.F should,
  show up here.
cheby_u.F	cheby_u_test.m		 fact.F       fact_test.m	    matlab_calls_f77.html
cheby_u.mexa64	cheby_u_test_output.txt  fact.mexa64  fact_test_output.txt


  Compile the file FACT.F.

  Get a directory listing.  A new file should show up,
  containing the compiled information.
cheby_u.F	cheby_u_test.m		 fact.F       fact_test.m	    matlab_calls_f77.html
cheby_u.mexa64	cheby_u_test_output.txt  fact.mexa64  fact_test_output.txt


  Now use FACT as though it were a MATLAB M-file function.
