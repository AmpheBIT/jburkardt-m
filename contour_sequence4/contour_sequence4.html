    <p>
      <b>CONTOUR_SEQUENCE4</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      reads one XY 
      coordinate file, and a sequence
      of U(X,Y) datasets, creates contour plots, and saves them as PNG files
      which can be combined into an animation (by Quicktime Pro, for instance).
    </p>

    <p>
      The solution files containing the U(X,Y) data should have   
      'consecutive' names, such as "fred01.txt", "fred02.txt", "fred03.txt"
      and so on.  The user only has to tell the program to process the 
      first file, and it will automatically continue to process files 
      until it reaches the end of the sequence of names.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The input files:
    </h2>

    <p>
      The X and Y input data files store the values of X and Y for points
      on a regularly spaced grid.  The grid does not have
      to be evenly spaced, but for this program to work, it must be the case
      that the (X,Y) points form an M by N grid, and that the value of X or 
      of Y is constant along a grid line!
    </p>

    <p>
      (In other words, a square grid is fine, but a rectangular grid is OK too.
      A rectangular grid with constant spacing is fine; a rectangular grid
      with variable spacing is also OK.  But a slanted, "wiggly" or curved grid 
      is no good.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Each U input data file is assumed to store the value of the
      associated scalar U.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, the grid of points in the data file must be listed in a 
      reasonable order, either by rows or by columns.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Internal processing:
    </h2>

    <p>
      The program has to figure out the grid parameters M and N, and convert
      the vectors of data X, Y, U into doubly indexed arrays that can be handled
      by the MATLAB contour routine.  Once the contour plot is displayed, an
      image of it is saved as a PNG file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the first file is processed, the routine checks to see if there
      is a second "consecutive" file, and it so, it is also processed, and 
      so on, until presumably all files in the sequence have been handled.
