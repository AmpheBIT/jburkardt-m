      SUDOKU <br> Solve a Sudoku Puzzle
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUDOKU</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      handles Sudoku puzzles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most interesting routine is <b>sudoku_solve.m</b>, which accepts a 
      partially worked-out Sudoku, and returns a solution.  It does
      this by using an exhaustive search.  That is, it finds the first
      empty spot in the grid, and then tries, in turn, putting in each
      of the digits in that spot.  Once it puts in the trial digit,
      it calls itself again with the slightly more filled-in puzzle.
      If the routine fills in the whole puzzle, it returns to the user.
      Otherwise, it backs up to the most recent trial digit, and increases
      it by one.  And if that's not possible, because we got to "9",
      it sets that cell back to blank, and backs up to the <i>previous</i>
      trial digit.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there is a solution, this procedure should find it.  However,
      I don't know what the routine will do if there is no solution.
      I don't know what the routine will do if there are multiple solutions
      (I assume it just comes back with one solution.)  And the routine
      does not check that your partially filled input puzzle is 
      consistent (doesn't have a 12 in one cell, or two 5's in one row.)
    </p>

    <p>
      A Sudoku has a lot of symmetry.  You can permute the digits.
      You can swap two rows if they are in the same row of boxes.
      You can swap two columns if they are in the same column of boxes.
      You can swap two columns of boxes, or two rows of boxes.
      Each of these operations preserves the underlying structure of
      the Sudoku.
