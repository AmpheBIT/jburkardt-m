CORRELATION_TEST02
  SAMPLE_PATHS_CHOLESKY generates sample paths from the
  correlation matrix, factored using the Cholesky factor.
  It requires that the correlation matrix is nonnegative definite.

  SAMPLE_PATHS_EIGEN generates sample paths from the
  correlation matrix, factored using the eigen factorization.
  If the correlation matrix is not nonnegative definite,
  we simply suppress negative eigenvalues.

  SAMPLE_PATHS_FFT generates sample paths from the
  correlation matrix, factored using the FFT factorization
  of the correlation matrix after embedding in a circulant.

CORRELATION_TEST05
  CORRELATION_BROWNIAN_DISPLAY displays the Brownian correlation

CORRELATION_TEST06
  For non-stationary correlation functions:

  SAMPLE_PATHS2_CHOLESKY generates sample paths from the
  correlation matrix, factored using the Cholesky factor.
  It requires that the correlation matrix is nonnegative definite.

  SAMPLE_PATHS2_EIGEN generates sample paths from the
  correlation matrix, factored using the eigen factorization.
  If the correlation matrix is not nonnegative definite,
  we simply suppress negative eigenvalues.

  SAMPLE_PATHS2_FFT generates sample paths from the
  correlation matrix, factored using the FFT factorization
  of the correlation matrix after embedding in a circulant.
