    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GRIDS_DISPLAY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      can read two ASCII
      files defining grids or sparse grids in 2D or 3D.  The first grid is
      plotted "lightly", in hollow blue dots, while the second is plotted
      with solid red dots.  The image is automatically
      saved to a <b>PNG</b> file.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>grids_display</b> ( <i>'file_name1'</i>, <i>'file_name2'</i>, 
          <i>rmin</i>, <i>rmax</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'file_name1'</i> is the file containing the first grid, to be shown in hollow blue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'file_name2'</i> is the file containing the second grid, to be shown in solid red.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>rmin, rmax</i> are the range in X, Y (and possibly Z) over which the plot 
          is to be displayed.  This is typically either [-1,1] or [0,1].  
          Some grids don't
          include points on the boundary, so it is useful to be able to 
          specify the plot range, and thus force the boundaries to show up,
          and to show up "in the same place" for multiple plots.  Also,
          this feature allows you to zoom in on part of the grid, if you wish.
        </li>
      </ul>
