      CG_DISTRIBUTED <br> Distributed Version of the NAS Conjugate Gradient Benchmark
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CG_DISTRIBUTED</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      implements a version of the NAS Conjugate Gradient (CG) Benchmark, using
      distributed memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not the true benchmark, since the distributed sparse array that 
      is created is made of random elements, rather than using the values and 
      locations specified by the NAS CG benchmark.  Thus, the example is 
      primarily a demonstration that a MATLAB linear algebra program that uses 
      arrays distributed across multiple processors can look almost identical 
      to a single processor version.
