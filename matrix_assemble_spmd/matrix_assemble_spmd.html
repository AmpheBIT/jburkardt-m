      MATRIX_ASSEMBLE_SPMD <br> SPMD (Single Program/Multiple Data) Matrix Assembly
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATRIX_ASSEMBLE_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the <b>SPMD</b> (single program, multiple data) command to
      assemble a large matrix as a collection of strips which are joined
      at the end of the computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MxN Hilbert matrix is to be computed.  Supposing we have K
      SPMD workers, each worker will generate a strip of size Mx(N/K).
      The SPMD client can concatenate these strips at the end of the
      computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this is a fairly trivial calculation, and not a terribly
      exciting exhibition of parallelism.  However, it is one step in a
      process of trying to figure out how a finite element code could
      use parallelism to assemble the system matrix, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function a = hilbert_fun ( m, n )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>m</i>, <i>n</i> are the number of rows and columns;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>a</i> is the computed matrix.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on a remote cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
