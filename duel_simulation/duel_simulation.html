      DUEL_SIMULATION <br> Simulation of a Duel
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DUEL_SIMULATION</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      simulates N instances of a duel between two players.
    </p>

    <p>
      Player 1 fires at player 2, and hits with a probability of P(1).
      If Player 1 misses, then Player 2 fires at Player 1, hitting with
      a probability of P(2).
    </p>

    <p>
      The duel continues with alternating shots until only one player
      survives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simulation is intended to estimate the probabilities that a
      player will survive, and the number of turns required.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exact probability that player 1 will survive is
      <blockquote>
        P(1) / ( P(1) + P(2) - P(1) * P(2) )
      </blockquote>
      while player 2's chance is
      <blockquote>
        P(2) * ( 1 - P(1) ) / ( P(1) + P(2) - P(1) * P(2) ).
      </blockquote>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        [ <i>s</i>, <i>turn_average</i> ] = <b>duel_simulation</b> ( <i>p</i>, <i>duel_num</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>p</i> is a vector of length 2 containing the probabilities that player 1 and player 2 will hit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>duel_num</i> is the number of duels to simulate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>s</i> is a vector of length 2 containing the probabilities that player 1
          or player 2 survives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>turn_average</i> is the average number of turns to complete the duel.
        </li>
      </ul>
