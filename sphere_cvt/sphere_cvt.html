    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_CVT</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      iteratively approximates a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) 
      on the unit sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CVT approximation algorithm used here is quite simple.  We start with XYZ, an
      arbitrary set of points on the unit sphere.  We compute the convex hull,
      from that the Delaunay triangulation, and from that the Voronoi diagram.
      Finally, we compute the centroids of the Voronoi polygons, and overwrite XYZ
      with this data.  This iteration may be carried out repeatedly.  While in the
      plane, the Voronoi cells all tend to the same shape and area, on a sphere there
      are certain constraints.  A typical CVT, if it has properly converged, will 
      generally have 12 pentagons, with the other polygons being hexagons.  Cases in
      which polygons of degree 4 or 7 occur indicate that the iteration is not
      near enough to completion.  Because of the occurrence of two polygonal shapes,
      the areas of the cells will tend to two separate values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code, as presented here, is quite preliminary.  In particular, the process
      of converting the Delaunay information into information about the Voronoi polygons
      is inefficient.  I suspect, though, that I can compute the centroids almost
      immediately, without having to go through the tedious process of determining
      the ordering of the Voronoi vertices that constitute each Voronoi polygon.
      If I can clear that up, then it should be possible to apply this simple algorithm
      to systems with hundreds of points.
