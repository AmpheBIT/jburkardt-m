    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATRIX_ASSEMBLE_PARFOR</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      demonstrates how a dense matrix can be define in parallel with
      the parfor() command.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elements of the Hilbert matrix are defined by:
      <pre>
        A(i,j) = 1 / ( i + j )
      </pre>
    </p>
