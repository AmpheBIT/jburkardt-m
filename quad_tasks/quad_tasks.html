    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUAD_TASKS</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      demonstrates how a numerical quadrature procedure can be carried
      out as a set of independent tasks whose results are combined at the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      The task computing feature of MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox is used
      to manage the creation, execution, and analysis of the multiple tasks.
