      HIGH_CARD_PARFOR <br>
      Estimate High Card Statistics in Parallel
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HIGH_CARD_PARFOR</b>
      is a MATLAB directory which
      uses the parfor statement to compute in parallel the statistics for
      a card game in which you are required to guess the location of the
      highest card.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rules for this game are as follows.  You are given a deck of DECK_SIZE cards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your goal is to select the high card.  For convenience, we can assume 
      the cards are a permutation of the integers from 1 to DECK_SIZE, but in
      fact the user mustn't see such values or else it's obvious which is the
      largest card.  (For a truly difficult problem, we'd have to work harder
      to disguise the range of values and the likely distribution!)
    </p>

    <p>
      Your choice is made under the following rules:  You may turn over
      one card at a time.  When a card is turned over, you may declare that to be
      your choice, or else turn over another card.  If you have not chosen a card
      by the end, then your choice is the final card.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have no idea what to do, and simply decide in advance to pick
      a card "at random", that is, for example, you decide to pick the 15th card
      before having seen any cards, then your probability of winning is 1/DECK_SIZE.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is, can you do better than that?
    </p>

    <p>
      A good strategy is as follows: always look at the first SKIP_NUM cards without
      choosing them.  Then choose the very next card you encounter that is larger
      than the cards you skipped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the question is, is there an optimal value of SKIP_NUM for a given DECK_SIZE?
      One way to find an approximate answer is to choose DECK_SIZE, and then, for
      each value of SKIP_NUM, play 1000 games, and keep track of how often you are right.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program demonstrates how such a computation can be done in parallel
      using the PARFOR command.
