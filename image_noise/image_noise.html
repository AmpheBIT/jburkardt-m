      IMAGE_NOISE <br> Add Noise to an Image
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_NOISE</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      add noise to an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      In MATLAB, a black and white or gray scale image can be represented
      using a 2D array of nonnegative integers over some range 0 to GMAX.
      The value 0 indicates black, and GMAX white.  Intermediate values
      represent shades of gray in a natural way.  Note, however, that
      the eye has a nonlinear response to intensity, so that the value
      GMAX/2 will not be perceived as halfway between 0 and GMAX.  That
      is a separate issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      A color image can be represented using a set of 3 2D arrays,
      which can be thought of as R, G, and B, and which represent the
      intensity of the red, green and blue signals that combine to
      form the color image.  A common maximum value is assumed, RGBMAX.
    </p>

    <p>
      An image can be read into MATLAB using the <b>imread</b> function
      in the Image Processing Toolbox, and displayed with the <b>imshow</b>
      function.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple model for noise involves replacing a subset of the image
      pixels by the extreme low or high values.  In a grayscale image,
      the damaged pixels show up as black or white spots, giving this kind
      of noise the name "salt and pepper".  An RGB image may be damaged
      by resetting all 3 color values at a given pixel, resulting in
      white or black pixels; however, a more realistic noise damage would
      simply choose R, G or B values randomly, so that noisy pixels would
      show up as those with full or zero value in one color channel, looking
      as though colored confetti had been tossed onto the image.
    </p>

    <p>
      More sophisticated models of noise damage involve setting a pixel
      color value to a uniform or normal random value, or to displacing
      the pixel color value by a uniform or normal random value.
