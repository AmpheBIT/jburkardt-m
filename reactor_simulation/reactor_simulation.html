      REACTOR_SIMULATION <br> Simulated Test of Reactor Shielding
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>REACTOR_SIMULATION</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      simulates the shielding effect of a slab intended to absorb
      or reflect most of the radiation from a neutron source.
      This program is intended as a simple demonstration of Monte Carlo
      simulation as applied to the analysis of complicated probabilistic
      systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>REACTOR_SIMULATION</b> is an example program that was developed
      in the book "Numerical Methods and Software".
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>REACTOR_SIMULATION</b> is a Monte Carlo simulation, using
      uniform random numbers, which investigates the
      effectiveness of a shield intended to absorb the
      neutrons emitted from a nuclear reactor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reactor is modeled as a point source,
      located at (0,0,0).
    </p>

    <p>
      A particle emitted from the reactor has a random
      initial direction, and an energy selected from
      [Emin,Emax] with a 1/Sqrt(E) distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shield is modeled as a wall of thickness THICK,
      extending from 0 to THICK in the X direction, and
      extending forever in the Y and Z directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based on the particle energy, a distance D is computed
      which measures how far the particle could travel through
      the shield before colliding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based on the particle direction, the position is updated
      by D units.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the particle is now to the left of the shield, it is
       counted as being REFLECTED.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the particle is to the right of the shield, it is
      counted as being ABSORBED.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the particle is inside the shield, it has COLLIDED.
      A particle that collides is either absorbed (end of story)
      or SCATTERED with a new random direction and a new (lower)
      energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every particle is followed from origin to its final fate,
      which is reflection, transmission, or absorption.
      At the end, a summary is printed, giving the number of
      particles with each fate, and the average energy of each
      group of particles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Increasing NTOT, the number of particles used, will improve the
      expected reliability of the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Increasing THICK, the thickness of the shield, should 
      result in more absorptions and reflections.
