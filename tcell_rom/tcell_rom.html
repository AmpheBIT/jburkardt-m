      TCELL_ROM <br> Reduced Order Model <br> For Flow in TCELL
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TCELL_ROM</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      handles reduced order
      model computations based on a finite element approximation of
      the fluid velocity in the time-dependent Navier Stokes equations
      in a region called the "T-Cell", 
      by Professor Hyung-Chun Lee.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reduced model was created by saving 500 "snapshots" of the computed
      flow field during a time evolution with varying boundary conditions,
      using the TCELL program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then a small basis set (typically of order 8) was extracted from these
      snapshots, using the CVT_BASIS program or
      the POD_BASIS program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some additional information, including the mass matrix and the
      initial value of the reduced order coefficients, was then computed
      using the TCELL_MASS program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the evolution of the coefficient vector of the reduced order
      model basis set could be computed.  This is done by a simple MATLAB
      program that calls an ODE solver.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "T-Cell" region is a T-shaped region contained in a subset
      of the unit square [01]x[01].  The top half of the region is a
      channel open to the left and right, with a rectangular recess in 
      the bottom.  The left channel opening extends from [0.0,0.5] to
      [0.0,1.0], and the right channel from [1.0,0.5] to [1.0,1.0].
      The recess is a square, whose bottom extends from [0.25,0.0] to
      [0.75,0.0], and which extends upward to meet the channel.

      The grid can be thought of as being generated by a uniform 81 by 81 
      uniformly spaced grid of nodes, from which the nodes corresponding to
      the two voids have been deleted.  This leaves 4,961 nodes.
      These nodes are organized into 2400 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure.
