SET_THEORY_TEST:
  Demonstrate some set theory operations that
  can be implemented in MATLAB.

  ISMEMBER ( I, A ) reports whether I is a member of A

  10 is not a member of A.
  11 is not a member of A.
  12 is a member of A.
  13 is not a member of A.
  14 is not a member of A.
  15 is not a member of A.
  16 is not a member of A.
  17 is a member of A.
  18 is not a member of A.
  19 is not a member of A.
  20 is not a member of A.

  ISMEMBER ( D, A ) reports whether D is a subset of A

  ( A intersect B ) is a subset of A.
