PGMA_IO_TEST
  Test the PGMA_IO ASCII portable grayscale routines.

TEST01
  PGMA_EXAMPLE sets up sample PGMA data.
  PGMA_WRITE writes an ASCII PGMA file.

  Wrote the header and data for "pgma_io_test01.ascii.pgm"
  Number of rows of data =    300
  Number of columns of data = 300

TEST02
  PGMA_READ reads an ASCII PGMA file.

  PGMA_WRITE_TEST created some data for us.

  PGMA_READ was able to read the ASCII PGMA file.

  Number of rows =    300
  Number of columns = 300

  Sample data:

   1     1      20
  34    34      74
  67    67      77
 100   100     130
 133   133     186
 167   167     189
 200   200     243
 233   233     299
 266   266     301
 300   300     356

TEST03
  PGMA_WRITE writes an ASCII PGM file.

  In this example, we make a sort of grayscale
  checkerboard.

  Created the file pgma_io_test03.ascii.pgm.

PGMA_IO_TEST
  Normal end of execution.
