    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_QUANTIZATION</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      demonstrates how the KMEANS algorithm can be used to reduce the number
      of colors or shades of gray in an image.

    <p>
      <a href = "../../m_src/cell_detection_tasks/cell_detection_tasks.html">
      CELL_DETECTION_TASKS</a>,
      a MATLAB program which
      creates modified versions of a sequence of gray-scale TIF files containing
      images of cells; the process of each file is carried out independently,
      using the "task" feature of MATLAB's parallel computing toolbox.

    <p>
      <a href = "../../m_src/color_remote/color_remote.html">
      COLOR_REMOTE</a>,
      a MATLAB program which
      carries out the color segmentation of an image in parallel,
      via SPMD commands; this includes instructions on how to run the job,
      via MATLAB's BATCH facility,
      on a remote system such as Virginia Tech's ITHACA cluster.

      <a href = "../../m_src/contrast_spmd/contrast_spmd.html">
      CONTRAST_SPMD</a>,
      a MATLAB program which
      demonstrates the SPMD parallel programming feature for image operations;
      the client reads an image, the workers increase contrast over separate portions, and
      the client assembles and displays the results.

    <p>
      <a href = "../../m_src/contrast2_spmd/contrast2_spmd.html">
      CONTRAST2_SPMD</a>,
      a MATLAB program which
      demonstrates the SPMD parallel programming feature for image operations;
      this improves the contrast_spmd program by allowing the workers to share some
      data; this makes it possible to eliminate artificial "seams" in the processed
      image.
