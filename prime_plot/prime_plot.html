      PRIME_PLOT <br> Box Plot of Primes
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PRIME_PLOT</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      displays a "box plot" of the prime and composite numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      An N by N grid A of squares is displayed.  If N is prime, then
      the squares A(N,1:N) are red.  If N is composite, then A(N,D)
      is blue for each divisor of N.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>prime_plot</b> ( <i>'n_max'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'n_max'</i> is the maximum value of N to check.  50 or 100 is
          reasonable.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
