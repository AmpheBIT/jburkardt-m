      Triangulation Quality Measures

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_QUALITY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      computes and prints a variety
      of quality measures for a given triangulation of a set of points in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The triangulation is defined by a <i>node file</i> containing
      the coordinates of nodes, and a <i>triangle file</i> containing
      sets of 3 or 6 node indices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quality measures computed include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Alpha</b>, the minimum angle divided by the maximum possible
          minimum angle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Area</b>, the ratio of the minimum area to the maximum area;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Q</b>, the triangle shape uniformity measure, twice the
          radius of the inscribed circle divided by the radius of the
          circumscribed circle;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each quality measure is defined as the minimum of its value
      over all the triangles; the maximum and best possible value is
      1, and the minimum and worst possible value is 0.
