TRIANGULATION_DELAUNAY_DISCREPANCY
  MATLAB version

  Read a node dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangulation file of TRIANGLE_NUM 
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.

  Determine the Delaunay discrepancy, that is, the amount
  by which the minimum angle in the triangulation could be
  changed by a single adjustment of a pair of triangles.

  If this discrepancy is negative,
  then the triangulation is not a Delaunay triangulation.

  If this discrepancy is 0 or essentially so, 
  then the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.
