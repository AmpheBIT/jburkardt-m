      THREED_TO_VTU <br> Write 3D Finite Element Data to VTU File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>THREED_TO_VTU</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      accepts a certain set of 3D finite element data
      and writes it to a VTK unstructured grid file for postprocessing by PARAVIEW.
    </p>

    <p>
      The finite element data is assumed to be given in terms of:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the xy coordinates of a set of nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          the (1-based) indices of nodes that form triangular elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          the values of U, V, and P at each node (velocity components
          and pressure).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program which generated the data is available as <b>NS3D_FEM</b>;
      it uses the finite element method to solve the steady, incompressible
      Navier Stokes equations for fluid flow.
