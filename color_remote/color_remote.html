      COLOR_REMOTE <br>
      Remote Execution of a Parallel MATLAB Program
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COLOR_REMOTE</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how to submit a parallel MATLAB program to run on a remote
      machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before remote submission of jobs is possible, you must have an account on
      the remote machine, and go through some steps to ensure that that machine
      and your desktop machine can communicate properly.  If you have not
      carried out these steps, refer to the document
      <i>"Notes on Enabling Remote Submission of MATLAB Jobs"</i> listed
      in the references below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nonparallel program <i>colorsegmentation.m</i> reads an array of 4 colors
      and a PNG file containing an image, and sequentially calls the
      <i>colorFilter.m</i> function
      to filter each of the given colors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The parallel program <i>colorSegmentationSol.m</i> uses an SPMD construct
      (Single Program Multiple Data) with four 'labs', one assigned to each color.
      Thus, we must first open a matlabpool with four labs.  The current version
      of the procedure uses the <i>imwrite</I> function inside the SPMD construct.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that, when run with a 'local' configuration, the resulting
      filtered images are written on the client machine, but when run with the
      'ithaca' configuration, the resulting files are created and left on the
      ITHACA cluster.  The user can retrieve the results by using, for instance,
      the SFTP program (Secure File Transfer Protocol).
    </p>

    <p>
      As an alternative, the program <i>colorSegmentationSol2.m</I> also uses an
      SPMD construct, but we assign the output of the function to a "composite
      variable".  This means that if the program is run remotely, the 4 images
      are returned to the client machine, and can be accessed by examining the
      four components of the composite variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be sure to close the matlabpool before exiting your MATLAB session.  You can
      test to see if you have an open matlabpool by typing:
      <blockquote>
        <i>value</i> = matlabpool ( 'size' )
      </blockquote>
      If <i>value</i> is returned as a positive number, you have an open matlabpool.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might find it convenient to create a file to take care of this automically,
      called <i>finish.m</i>
      <pre>
%FINISH finish file
%
% FINISH  finish file
%   Change the name of this file to FINISH.M. The file
%   is executed when MATLAB finishing

 sz = matlabpool('size');
 if sz > 0
   disp(['a Matlabpool of size ' int2str(sz) ' is open.'])
   val = input('Do you want to close the matlabpool (y/n) ?','s');
   if val == 'n' || val == 'N'
       return
   else
      matlabpool close
   end
 end

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To run the nonparallel version of the program:
      <blockquote>
        colorSegmentation
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the first parallel version of the program:
      <blockquote>
        colorSegmentationSol ( <i>'configuration'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'configuration'</i> is either 'local', for local execution,
          or 'ithaca', to run remotely on ITHACA.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the second parallel version of the program:
      <blockquote>
        <i>image</i> = colorSegmentationSol2 ( <i>'configuration'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'configuration'</i> is either 'local', for local execution,
          or 'ithaca', to run remotely on ITHACA.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>image</i> is a composite variable whose four components are
          the four color-filtered images.
        </li>
      </ul>
