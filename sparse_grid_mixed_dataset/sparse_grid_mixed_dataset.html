      SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_DATASET <br> Create Sparse Grid Using Mixed Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_DATASET</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      creates a sparse grid dataset from a mixture of 1D rules, using
      instructions from a user.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_DATASET</b> relies on the availability of
      two other directories of MATLAB functions, namely
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_MIXED</b> and <b>SANDIA_RULES</b>.  As written,
      it will issue the commands
      <pre>
        addpath ( '../sparse_grid_mixed' )
        addpath ( '../sandia_rules' )
      </pre>
      so these directories would need to be downloaded from the web
      and installed in directories that are at the same level as the
      directory containing <b>SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_DATASET</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The available 1D quadrature rules are identified by a 2 or 3 letter code,
      and include:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>CC</b>, Clenshaw-Curtis:<br>
           defined on [-1,+1], with w(x)=1,<br>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The user first specifies:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b> the spatial dimension of the quadrature region,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>L</b> the level that defines the Smolyak grid.
        </li>
      </ul>
      and these two values can actuallyb be specified on the command line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the user specifies rules for each of the M dimensions.
      A rule, when specified, may be used for one, or for multiple consecutive
      dimensions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          RULE identifies the 1D rule, and must be one of
          "CC", "F2", "GP", "GL", "GH", "GGH", "LG", "GLG", "GJ", "GW",
          "CCS", "F2S", "GPS".
        </li>
        <li>
          the number of times the rule is to be used for consecutive dimensions;
        </li>
        <li>
          ALPHA, a rule parameter, if needed.  (Rules GGH, GLG and GJ);
        </li>
        <li>
          BETA, a rule parameter, if needed.  (Rule GJ only).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the user specifies a "file identifier", that is, the main part
      of a string to be used when creating the files.
