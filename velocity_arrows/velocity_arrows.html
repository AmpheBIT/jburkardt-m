      VELOCITY_ARROWS <br> Plot Velocity Arrows
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>VELOCITY_ARROWS</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      makes an arrow plot 
      of a velocity field, using XY and UV data stored as 
      <a href = "../../data/table/table.html">TABLE files</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is mainly a preprocessor for MATLAB's <b>quiver</b>
      routine.  It reads the (X,Y) coordinates of a set of points from an
      "XY" file, and the corresponding horizontal and vertical velocities
      from a "UV" file.  It then makes a few settings, calls <b>quiver</b>
      to plot the arrows, and also traces out the convex hull of the points,
      which is presumably the boundary of the region.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>velocity_arrows</b> ( <i>node_file</i>, <i>vector_file</i>, <i>scale</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>node_file</i> is the name of the node file, which must be a quoted string;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>vector_file</i> is the name of the vector file, which must be a quoted string;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>scale</i> is a scale factor.  Start with 1.0 if you don't know what you want.
        </li>
      </ul>
