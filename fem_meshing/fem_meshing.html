      FEM_MESHING <br> Simple Issues in 2D Mesh Generation for the Finite Element Method
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM_MESHING</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      looks at some simple issues in defining a geometric mesh for
      the finite element method in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The issues raised here are simple examples that arose during a presentation
      on finite element meshing.  That presentation is available in
      <a href = "../../classes/fem_2011/fem_meshing.pdf">

    <p>
      There are various simple scripts to display the mesh.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "boundary_display.m">boundary_display.m</a>,
          displays vertices V and boundary indices BI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "node_display.m">node_display.m</a>,
          displays vertices V, boundary indices BI, and nodes P.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "triangulation_display.m">triangulation_display.m</a>,
          displays vertices V, boundary indices BI, nodes P, and triangles T.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is useful to write the P and T data to files, so that they
      can later be read by a C++ or FORTRAN90 program.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "node_write.m">node_write.m</a>,
          writes the node data to a file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "triangle_write.m">triangle_write.m</a>,
          writes the triangle data to a file.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The C++ function "triangle_read" suggests one way to read a triangle file.
      There is also an example program which shows how the function can be
      used to read the triangles associated with the ELL region.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "triangle_read.cpp">triangle_read.cpp</a>,
          a C++ function to read a triangle file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "triangle_read_example.cpp">triangle_read_example.cpp</a>,
          a C++ program which reads the ELL triangle data.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The FORTRAN90 routine "triangle_read" suggests one way to read a triangle file.
      There is also an example program which shows how the function can be
      used to read the triangles associated with the ELL region.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "triangle_read.f90">triangle_read.f90</a>,
          a FORTRAN90 routine to read a triangle file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "triangle_read_example.f90">triangle_read_example.f90</a>,
          a FORTRAN90 program which reads the ELL triangle data.
        </li>
