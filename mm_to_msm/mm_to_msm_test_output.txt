MM_TO_MSM_TEST:
  MM_TO_MSM can read a Matrix Market file and convert 
  the information into a Matlab Sparse Matrix.

  We will read the file "wathen_29_29_adg.txt".

  Matrix order is 29 rows by 29 columns
  Number of entries is 841
  Matrix representation is "array"
  Matrix arithmetic field is "double"
  Matrix symmetry type is "general"

  Whether A is full or sparse, we can manipulate it
  now with MATLAB.  Here we get the eigenvalues.
  For the Wathen matrix, these will all be positive.

  Eigenvalues of the Wathen matrix:

  7.423296
