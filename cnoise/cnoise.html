      CNOISE <br> 1/F^alpha Power Law Noise Generation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CNOISE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      generates sequences that simulate 1/f^alpha power law noise.  This includes 
      white noise (alpha = 0), pink noise (alpha = 1) and red or Brownian noise (alpha = 2),
      as well as noise for values of alpha between 0 and 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>CNOISE</b> is based in part on an algorithm by Kasdin,
      as cited in the references.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kasdin's implementation referenced a number of functions from the
      Numerical Recipes library (FOUR1, FREE_VECTOR, GASDEV, RAN1,
      REALFT, VECTOR).  Numerical Recipes is a proprietary library
      whose components cannot be freely distributed.  Moreover,
      the Fourier transform functions require the size of the data
      to be a power of 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version of the program is implemented as a MATLAB function.
      The Fourier transform functions that are invoked can handle input
      data of any size.
    </p>

    <p>
      Versions of the algorithm are implemented which generate a vector x
      of size N with a 1/f^alpha frequency distribution, with three choices
      for the underlying distribution of the white noise vector:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>f_alpha_uniform ( n, range, alpha )</b>,
          a uniform distribution on (-range,+range);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>f_alpha_gaussian ( n, q_d, alpha )</b>,
          a Gaussian distribution with mean 0, variance q_d;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>f_alpha_tgaussian ( n, q_d, range, alpha )</b>,
          a Gaussian distribution with mean 0,
          variance q_d, truncated to (-range,range).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
