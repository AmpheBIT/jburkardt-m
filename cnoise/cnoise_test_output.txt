CNOISE_TEST:
  Test the CNOISE library.

CNOISE_TEST01:
  Test F_ALPHA_GAUSSIAN.
  Noise is generated from a Gaussian distribution
  with a specified variance.

  Number of realizations M = 10000
  Dimension of noise vector N = 10000
  Noise exponent ALPHA = 1.000000
  Variance of Gaussian distribution VAR = 1.000000
  Scale factor SCALE = 1.000000

  Mean value of noise = -0.004831
  STD of noise        = 0.799829
  Computation time    = 22.543071 seconds

CNOISE_TEST02:
  Test F_ALPHA_TGAUSSIAN.
  Noise is generated from a truncated Gaussian distribution
  with a specified variance and range.

  Number of realizations M = 10000
  Dimension of noise vector N = 10000
  Noise exponent ALPHA = 1.000000
  Variance of Gaussian distribution VAR = 1.000000
  Truncated range = [ -1.000000, 1.000000 ]
  Scale factor SCALE = 1.000000

  Mean value of noise = -0.006726
  STD of noise        = 0.576068
  Computation time    = 24.700544 seconds

CNOISE_TEST03:
  Test F_ALPHA_UNIFORM.
  Noise is generated from a Gaussian distribution
  with a specified variance.
