      THREED_TO_VU <br> Write 3D Finite Element Data to VU File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>THREED_TO_VU</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      accepts computational data from a 3D finite element fluid flow program 
      and writes it to a VU file for postprocessing by VU.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program which generated the data is available as <b>NS3D_FEM</b>;
      it uses the finite element method to solve the steady, incompressible 
      Navier Stokes equations for fluid flow.

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>CASE1</b> is a built-in example, which can be run by the command
      <pre>
        steady_navierstokes_3d ( 1 )
      </pre>
      All data for this example is generated internally; no input files are needed.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "case1_output.vu">case1_output.vu</a>, 
          computed (U,V,W) and P 
          data in a VU file suitable for input to VU.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>CASE2</b> is a built-in example, which can be run by the command
      <pre>
        steady_navierstokes_3d ( 2 )
      </pre>
      This example needs some large external input files.
