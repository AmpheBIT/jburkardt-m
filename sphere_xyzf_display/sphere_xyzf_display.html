      SPHERE_XYZF_DISPLAY <br>
      Display Unit Sphere + 3D Points + Faces <br>
      in the 3D MATLAB Graphics Window
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_XYZF_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads information identifying
      an XYZ data file containing a list of 3D point coordinates
      and an XYZF file listing point indices that form faces,
      and displays a unit sphere, the points, and the faces,
      in a 3D MATLAB graphics window.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is difficult to visualize points and faces that lie on the unit
      sphere.  You can't see the curving surface, and you can see points
      and faces that should not be visible, because they are on the other side of
      the sphere.  By starting the display with a unit sphere, and then
      adding the 3D points and faces you want to see, both of these problems are
      resolved.  The addition of the sphere gives important visual cues
      as to how to "read" the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The files containing the point coordinates and the face indices are
      in the <b>XYZ</b> and <b>XYZF</b> formats respectively.
      The MATLAB command <b>patch</b> is used to display the faces, and
      <b>plot3</b> displays the points.  The sphere is generated by the
      <b>sphere</b> command and displayed with the <b>surf</b> command.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_XYZF_DISPLAY</b> is essentially a version of <b>XYZF_DISPLAY</b>
      with the addition of a displayed sphere.  It seems like a small change,
      but for spherical point data, it makes a huge difference.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>sphere_xyzf_display</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i>.xyz is an XYZ file of point coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i>.xyzf is an XYZF file of point indices forming faces;
        </li>
      </ul>
      and displays a plot of the points and faces.
