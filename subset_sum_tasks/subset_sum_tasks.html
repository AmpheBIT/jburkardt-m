      Solve a Subset Sum Problem using Multiple Tasks
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUBSET_SUM_TASKS</b>
      is a directory which
      illustrates how a subset sum problem can be solved by dividing it into
      a number of tasks, and then having each task executed independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      In task computing, a problem is broken down into subproblems,
      each of which can be solved separately, simultaneously or sequentially.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB implements task computing by having the user define a
      "job" which in turn is composed of several "tasks".  Each task is
      carried out by calling a MATLAB function with specific arguments, and
      the tasks are carried out in some order, over some set of processors,
      when the job is submitted for execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the subset sum problem, we are given a
      collection of (21) weights and a
      <i>target value</i> (24639098).  We are to decide which combination(s) of weights
      yield a sum equal to the target value.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <i>subset_sum_job_local.m</i> is responsible for solving the problem.
      It does this by breaking it down into four smaller problems, defining
      each subproblem as a task.  The program <i>subset_sum_task.m</i> carries out
      any one of these tasks, by looping through a range of possible weight
      combinations and reporting the  weight labels and values that achieve the
      required sum.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <i>subset_sum_job_local.m</i> executes the tasks on the local machine.
      With only a small change, the program <i>subset_sum_job_ithaca.m</i> runs
      the tasks on the Ithaca cluster.  The program <i>subset_sum_fsu.m</i> runs
      the tasks on FSU's HPC cluster.
