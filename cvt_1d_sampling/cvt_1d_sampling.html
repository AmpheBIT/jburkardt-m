      CVT_1D_SAMPLING <br> Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation in [0,1]
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_1D_SAMPLING</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      allows the user to carry out Lloyd's algorithm for a centroidal
      Voronoi Tessellation in the interval [0,1].
    </p>

    <p>
      The determination of the Voronoi regions is carried out using
      sampling.  This means that the convergence of the iteration is
      influenced by the accuracy of the estimates provided by sampling.
    </p>

    <p>
      For <b>n</b> generators, the solution is known in advance:
      <blockquote>
        x(i) = ( 2 * i - 1 ) / ( 2 * n )
      </blockquote>
      Lloyd's algorithm starts from an arbitrary vector <b>x</b>, however,
      so it is interesting to see how the approximate solution evolves
      toward the correct answer.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>cvt_1d_sampling</b> ( <i>n</i>, <i>it_num</i>, <i>sample_num</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>n</i> is the number of generators;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>it_num</i> is the number of iterative steps to take.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>sample_num</i> is the number of sample points in [0,1]
          used to estimate the Voronoi regions.  A value between 1,000
          and 100,000 is typical.
        </li>
      </ul>
