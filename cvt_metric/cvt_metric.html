      CVT_METRIC <br> CVT Calculation With Varying Metric
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_METRIC</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      computes a CVT (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation)
      calculation under a spatially varying metric.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we are saying is that the distance between two vectors
      <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> is no longer simply the Euclidean distance,
      but rather a quadratic form involving a spatially varying,
      positive definite symmetric matrix that represents the metric:
      <pre><b>
        d(a,b) = ( a - b )' * A * ( a - b )
      </b></pre>
      We assume that <b>A</b> varies spatially, but we would prefer
      to simplify this variation in a manner that saves us computational
      effort, while allowing us to recover the variational behavior
      if we are willing to use a finer spatial sampling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The metric function is distinct from the <i>density</i> function,
      which can also be used in these kinds of problems.  The density
      function is weaker, and corresponds to a metric whose matrix
      at any point is a multiple of the identity matrix.  A density
      function approach cannot result in the more interesting anisotropic
      effects that an arbitrary metric produces.

      Here are images of CVT point sets.  These are crude
      calculations, with a relatively low number of sample
      points and iterations.  This is partly because I haven't
      figured out how to optimize these calculations in MATLAB.
