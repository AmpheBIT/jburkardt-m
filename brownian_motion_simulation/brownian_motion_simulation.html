    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BROWNIAN_MOTION_SIMULATION</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      simulates Brownian motion in an M-dimensional region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Brownian motion is a physical phenomenon which can be observed, for
      instance, when a small particle is immersed in a liquid.  The particle
      will move as though under the influence of random forces of varying
      direction and magnitude.  
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a mathematical idealization of this motion, and from there a computational
      discretization that allows us to simulate the successive positions of
      a particle undergoing Brownian motion.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>x</i> = <b>brownian_motion_simulation</b> ( <i>n</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>t</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where

          <i>n</i> is the number of time steps to take (default 1000);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>m</i> is the spatial dimension, (default 2);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>d</i> is the diffusion coefficient, (default 10.0);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>t</i> is the total time interval (default 1.0);
