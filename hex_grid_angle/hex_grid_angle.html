    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HEX_GRID_ANGLE</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      produces a hexagonal grid of points in the unit
      square or an arbitrary box, allowing the user to specify an 
      arbitrary center, angle, and grid density.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, the grid begins with a single point called <b>CENTER</b>,
      whose location in the unit square or box is specified by the user.  The
      next "layer" of points is produced by stepping out <b>H</b> units
      in a user-specified direction <b>ANGLE</b>, and marking off points
      on the hexagon.  Further layers of points are added until a layer
      is reached that lies entirely outside the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>HEX_GRID_ANGLE</b> was developed to allow more flexibility
      than the <a href = "../../m_src/hex_grid/hex_grid.html">HEX_GRID</a>
      library provided.  In particular, that library always starts
      the grid at the origin, always runs the first grid line
      along the X-axis, and always requires that the first grid
      line terminate exactly with at point at X = 1.  By contrast,
      the <b>HEX_GRID_ANGLE</b> library allows the user total freedom
      to specify the center, angle, and spacing of the hexagonal grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      One reason for developing this library was to try to see whether
      you could always force 100 points of the hexagonal grid to fall
      into the unit square simply by choosing a spacing <b>H</b> that
      guaranteed that the Voronoi region around each point (also a
      hexagon) had an area of 1/100.  We finally realized that this
      cannot be guaranteed, since the hexagonal and Cartesian coordinate
      systems are "incommensurable".  They only match up asymptotically.
      So, even though we carefully chose the spacing <b>H</b>, it is only
      on average that we found 100 points in a unit square, but
      also found squares with 98, 99, or 104 points as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, it will not be possible to choose a hexagonal grid with
      the property that it is equivalent to the tessellation generated by
      the the intersection of the hexagonal grid with a single unit square.
