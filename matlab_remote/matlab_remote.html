      Remote Computing with MATLAB
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_REMOTE</b>
      is a directory of information which
      discusses the use of remote computing with MATLAB.
    </p>

    <p>
      The latest versions of MATLAB include a facility for preparing jobs and data
      on a desktop machine, and then submitting them for execution on a remote machine.
      The local copy of MATLAB is responsible for communicating with the remote machine,
      transferring files and data to the remote machine,
      setting up the appropriate job control language and submitting a job there,
      and then retrieving the results when the job is completed.  In the meantime,
      the user can do other work, or turn off MATLAB, or in fact turn off the
      desktop computer and go home for a while!
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a number of steps that must be taken to ensure that this remote
      job submission process works correctly.  These steps are outlined in the
      document "Notes on Enabling Remote Submission of MATLAB Jobs".
    </p>

    <p>
      In outline, these steps involve:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Setting up passwordless remote access to Ithaca from your machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copying some necessary files into the <b>toolbox/local</b> subdirectory
          of your copy of MATLAB.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copying a parallel configuration file <i>ithaca_2009b.mat</i> to
          your machine, installing it into MATLAB, and modifying it appropriately
          for your environment.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once these steps are completed, you should try first to validate the
      ithaca_2009b configuration.  Then you could go to the directory
      <a href = "../../m_src/matlab_distcomp/matlab_distcomp.html">MATLAB_DISTCOMP</a>
      and download the set of tests there.  Then by typing the single command <b>test_all</b>,
      your local copy of MATLAB can send commands and data to ITHACA for processing
      there.
    </p>

    <p>
      One issue is that certain MATLAB utility functions must be copied into
      the <b>toolbox/local</b> directory on the user's desktop machine.  These
      scripts may be found lower down on this page.
