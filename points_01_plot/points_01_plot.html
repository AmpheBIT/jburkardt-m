    <p>
      <b>POINTS_01_PLOT</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      can read an ASCII
      file defining a set of points in the unit square [0,1] by [0,1]. 
      The program can also automatically save the image in a file.  Either EPS 
      (Encapsulated PostScript) or PNG can be used.

    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>points_01_plot</b> ( <i>'file_name'</i> )
        </dt>
        <dd>
          plots the points in the [0,1] square 
          from the file <i>'file_name'</i>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>points_01_eps</b> ( <i>'file_name'</i> )
        </dt>
        <dd>
          plots the points in the [0,1] square
          from the file <i>'file_name'</i> and
          saves an EPS file;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>points_01_png</b> ( <i>'file_name'</i> )
        </dt>
        <dd>
          plots the points in the [0,1] square
          from the file <i>'file_name'</i> and
          saves an PNG file;
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>points_11_png</b> ( <i>'file_name'</i> )
        </dt>
        <dd>
          plots the points in the [-1,1] square
          from the file <i>'file_name'</i> and
          saves an PNG file;
        </dd>
