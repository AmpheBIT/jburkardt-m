      NS3D_FEM <br> Steady Navier Stokes Equations in 3D <br> Finite Element Solution
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NS3D_FEM</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      sets up and solves a finite
      element formulation of the steady 3D Navier Stokes equations in an
      arbitrary geometry defined by the user,
      by Jeff Borggaard.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user defines the geometry as a collection of tetrahedrons.  These
      tetrahedrons may be <i>linear</i> (using four nodes) or <i>quadratic</i>
      (using ten nodes, which are the four vertices and the six midside nodes).
    </p>

    <p>
      The data from the program can be written out to a graphics file suitable
      for use with a visualization program.  This is done by "turning on" the
      appropriate call in <b>steady_navierstokes_3d.m</b>  There are currently
      several functions that can be called, to make an output file of various types:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>threed_to_tecplot</b> creates an output file for TECPLOT.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>threed_to_vtk</b> creates a "legacy" (old style)
          VTK output file for PARAVIEW.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>threed_to_vtu</b> creates a modern (XML-based)
          VTU output file for PARAVIEW.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>threed_to_vu</b> creates an output file for VU.
