      GRAPH_REPRESENTATION <br> Representations of a Graph
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GRAPH_REPRESENTATION</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      can determine various representations of a graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the routines take as input the number of nodes,
      the node coordinates, the number of edges, and the edges as
      a list of pairs of node indices.  They then produce an object
      related to a representation of the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Graphs are abstract models of a set of objects and some kind
      of pairwise relationship that exists between some pairs of
      the objects.  The objects are called <i>nodes</i> and the
      relationships are called <i>edges</i> or <i>links</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A graph is often depicted as a set of points (the nodes),
      some pairs of which are connected by lines (the edges or links).
    </p>

    <p>
      A <b>simple graph</b> is a set of NV vertices <b>V</b> and a set of
      NE edges <b>E</b>, where each edge <b>e</b> in <b>E</b> is a set of
      two distinct nodes from <b>V</b>.  By the conventions of set theory,
      no distinction is made between the edges (A,B) and (B,A).
      This corresponds to the idea that the relationship being represented
      is symmetric.
    </p>

      Graph Representations and Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      Perhaps the simplest description of a graph is the <b>edge list</b>.
      This representation consists of a list of the pairs of nodes that
      are joined by an edge.  If (A,B) is given in the list, then
      the equivalent pair (B,A) is not listed.  For convenience, it is
      often the case that the pair is chosen in which the first node
      has a lower numeric index than the second.  Similarly, the order
      in which these edges appear in the edge list, while not specified,
      is often chosen to be ascending order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another representation of a graph is the <b>adjacency matrix</b>.
      This is an NV by NV matrix A in which A(I,J) is the number of edges
      between nodes I and J.  Ordinarily, this value is either 0 or 1,
      although there are natural extensions to this idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given an ordering of the edges as well as the nodes, we can
      represent the graph by an <b>incidence matrix</b> which is an
      NE by NV matrix, such that A(I,J) is 0 unless edge I uses node J
      as one of its two endpoints.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>adjacency structure</b> of a graph is, ideally, a list of
      NV lists.  For node I, the list contains all nodes joined by an
      edge to node I.  The length of the list for each node may be
      anything from 0 to NV-1; in MATLAB this data structure can be
      represented by a cell array.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the cell array or list-of-lists data type is not available,
      the information in the adjacency structure can also be constructed
      by a pair of vectors.  The first, the <b>adjacency list</b>, is
      simply the list of all the node neighbors of node 1, followed by
      those for node 2, and so on.  The <b>adjacency pointer</b> is a
      vector of length NV+1, which can be used to locate the data for
      a given node within the adjacency list.  In particular, the neighbors
      of node I are listed in the adjacency list between the entry
      specified by pointer value I, up to, but not including, the entry
      specified by pointer I+1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since it is quite common to represent a graph as a drawing,
      or to abstract a graph from a physical situation in which the
      nodes have positions, it is also useful to have available the
      <b>node coordinates</b>, which are simply the (X,Y) coordinates
      of each node.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, it may be more suggestive to refer to nodes by letter
      or name or some other label.  Thus a <b>node label</b> array can
      be an auxilliary item of data.
    </p>

    <p>
      One format for storing graph information included the ability to
      store a numeric label, the node coordinates, and the neighbors
      of a node.  This is called the <b>grf format</b>.  There are a few
      utilities for displaying an image of a graph that has been
      represented in this format.
