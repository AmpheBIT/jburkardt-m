      HOT_POINT <br> A Sample Heat Flow Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HOT_POINT</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      describes a particular
      heat problem suitable for solution by FEM_50_HEAT, 
      a MATLAB program that solves the time dependent heat equation
      in two dimensions,
      by Jochen Alberty, Carsten Carstensen, Stefan Funken.
    </p>

    <p>
      The region is the unit square, containing 169 nodes, whose locations
      are specified in <a href = "coordinates.txt">coordinates.txt</a>.
      You may examine
      a PNG image of the nodes in
      <a href = "nodes.png">nodes.png</a>, created by the
      <a href = "../m_src/triangulation_plot/triangulation_plot.html">
      TRIANGULATION_PLOT</a> program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Triangular elements are used (in fact, FEM_50_HEAT can't currently use
      quadrilateral elements.)  The triples of nodes that form each triangle
      are listed in <a href = "elements3.txt">elements3.txt</a>.
      You may examine
      a PNG image of the elements in
      <a href = "elements.png">elements.png</a>, created by the
      TRIANGULATION_PLOT program..
    </p>

    <p>
      The pair of data files <a href = "coordinates.txt">coordinates.txt</a> and
      <a href = "elements3.txt">elements3.txt</a> describe an
      order 3 triangulation.  For more examples of this data structure,
      see 
      <a href = "../...txta/triangulation_order3/triangulation_order3.html">
      the order 3 triangulation.txta page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may examine 
      a PNG image of the grid, which
      displays both the nodes and elements, in
      <a href = "grid.png">grid.png</a>, created by the
      TRIANGULATION_PLOT program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied on the boundary, of the
      form
      <pre><b>
        U(x,y,t) = 0.1 * ( x + y )
      </b></pre>
      The list of element sides at which these conditions apply are
      given in <a href = "dirichlet.txt">dirichlet.txt</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The (time dependent) right hand side of the Dirichlet conditions 
      is evaluated by the function <a href = "u_d.m">u_d.m</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      No Neumann boundary conditions are applied.
      The (empty) list of element sides at which these conditions apply are
      given in <a href = "neumann.txt">neumann.txt</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The right hand side of the (empty) Neumann conditions is
      evaluated by the function <a href = "g.m">g.m</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial condition is
      <pre><b>
        U(x,y,t_start) = 0
      </b></pre>
      at all points, except a single point in the center, whose
      initial value is 1.  The initial condition information is
      evaluated by the function <a href = "u_init.m">u_init.m</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The time dependent heat equation has the form
      <pre><b>
        dU/dt = Uxx + Uyy + F(x,y,t)
      </b></pre>
      The right hand side function <b>F(x,y,t)</b> is zero
      and is evaluated by the function <a href = "f.m">f.m</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Internal to the script FEM_50_HEAT are statements that choose
      parameter values.  For this run, we suggest using:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>t_start</b>, the initial time, set to 0;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>t_final</b>, the final time, which we set to 0.004;
        </li>
        <li> 
          <b>NT</b>, the number of time steps, set to 100.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Any of these quantities may be changed to values that you
      find more suitable.
