    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GAMBLERS_RUIN_SIMULATION</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      simulates the game of gambler's ruin.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the game of gambler's ruin, two gamblers, A and B, start with
      $A_STAKES and $B_STAKES, respectively, and play until one of them
      is bankrupt.  They repeatedly flip a coin.  On heads, A wins one dollar from B,
      and on tails, B wins one dollar from A.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is easy to simulate, and can also be analyzed.  It is worth
      study in part because the analysis or simulation of the game reveals
      some surprising features about the chances of winning, the typical length
      of a game, and the number of times each player will be in the lead.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, most people will be surprised to find that if A starts with
      $1 and B with $100, the "average" game will take 100 coin tosses.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is known that, if A and B start the game with $A_STAKES and $B_STAKES,
      <ul>
        <li>
          the expected number of coin tosses required to complete the game is
          A_STAKES * B_STAKES.
        </li>
        <li>
          the probability that A will win the game is A_STAKES / ( A_STAKES+B_STAKES).
        </li>
        <li>
          the lead may change many times in one game, but, if a large number of
          games are played, the most common case is that the lead never changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the game of gambler's ruin can be regarded as a case of a 1D
      random walk in a finite region, in which the "particle" starts A_STAKES
      steps from one wall and B_STAKES steps from the other, and in which
      the walk ends when the particle strikes a wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <b>GAMBLERS_RUIN_PLOT</b> displays the "score" for player A
      at each step of the game.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <b>GAMBLERS_RUIN_SIMULATION</b> plays the game a number of times,
      and computes statistics of the number of steps and the probability of winning,
      as well as histograms of the number of steps and the number of times the
      lead was reversed.
