      MESH2D <br> Automatic 2D Mesh Generation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MESH2D</b>
      is a MATLAB program which generates
      and unstructured meshes in 2D, 
      by Darren Engwirda.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is relatively simple, flexible and powerful.  The user is able to define
      a variety of geometric shapes, and desired mesh densities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MESH2D</b> is most useful because it allows a user to specify 
      a shape or region, which the program will then fill with a triangular mesh.
      The density of the triangular mesh can be uniform, or the user can request
      that smaller triangles be used near certain features of the region.  The
      program relies heavily on the features of the Delaunay triangulation,
      which chooses, among all possible triangulations of a set of points, that
      triangulation which best avoids small angles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interested users should probably refer to the copy of <b>MESH2D</b>
      that is made available through the MATLAB Central File Exchange.
      This copy is essentially my personal working copy, to which I may
      have added comments, small coding changes, and extra tests and examples.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
          [ <i>p, t</i> ] = <b>mesh2d</b> ( <i>vertices, edge, hdata, options</i> );
      </blockquote>
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>vertices</i>, required input, a V by 2 list of (X,Y) coordinates of
          vertices of the boundary.  If <i>vertices</i> is the only input argument,
          then it must be the case that the vertices are listed consecutively.
          Otherwise, assuming <i>edge</i> is supplied, the vertices can be given
          in any order.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>edge</i>, optional input, a V by 2 list of pairs of indices in the
          <i>vertices</i> array that constitute the edges of the polygonal boundary.
          If <i>vertices</i> is actually already in order, then <i>edge</i>, if specified,
          would contain the values [1,2; 2,3; 3,4; ... ; V,1].
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>, optional input, a structure containing element size information
          (see below).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>, optional input that allows the user to modify the default
          behavior of the solver (see below).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>p</i>, (output), an N by 2 list of node coordinates.  The number of
          nodes generated, N, is determined in part by the size of the edges
          along the boundary, and by other user input such as the maximum element
          size, and the user size function, if supplied.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>t</i>, (output), an M by 3 list of node indices, forming counterclockwise
          triangles.  The number of triangles created depends on the number of nodes
          created.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>hdata</b>, the element size information.  This structure, if supplied,
      can include the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>hmax</b>, the maximum allowable global element size.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>edgeh</b>, an array of element sizes on specified geometry
          edges, where <i>e1</i> is an index into the <i>edge</i> array.  The
          <b>edgeh</b> component would have the form [e1,h1; e2,h2; ...], where
          the user has specified a certain number of sizes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>fun</b>, the name of a function preceded by an AT sign,
          which is the user-defined size function.  <b>fun</b> must have the form
          <blockquote>
            h = fun ( x, y, args{} )
          </blockquote>
          where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are vectors of point coordinates, and <i>args</i>
          is an optional addition set of input set in <i>hdata</i>.<b>args</b>.
          The function returns the user-desired elementsize at the given points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>args</b> = {arg1, arg2, ...} contains additional arguments,
          if any, for <i>hdata</i>.<b>fun</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>options</b> allows the user to modify the default behavior of the solver.
      This structure, if supplied, can include the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>mlim</b> is the convergence tolerance. The maximum relative
          change in edge length per iteration must be less than this value, which
          defaults to 0.02.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>maxit</b>, the maximum allowable number of iterations,
          which defaults to 20.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>dhmax</b>, the maximum allowable (relative) gradient in the size 
          function, which defaults to 0.3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>output</b>, a "logical" variable which displays the mesh 
          and the mesh statistics upon completion, and defaults to "TRUE", that is, 1.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
