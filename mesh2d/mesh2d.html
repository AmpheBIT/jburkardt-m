      MESH2D <br> Automatic 2D Mesh Generation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MESH2D</b>
      is a MATLAB program which generates
      unstructured meshes in 2D, 
      by Darren Engwirda.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is relatively simple, flexible and powerful.  The user is able 
      to define a variety of geometric shapes, and desired mesh densities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MESH2D</b> is most useful because it allows a user to specify 
      a shape or region, which the program will then fill with a triangular mesh.
      The density of the triangular mesh can be uniform, or the user can request
      that smaller triangles be used near certain features of the region.  The
      program relies heavily on the features of the Delaunay triangulation,
      which chooses, among all possible triangulations of a set of points, that
      triangulation which best avoids small angles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interested users should refer to the copy of <b>MESH2D</b>
      that is made available through the MATLAB Central File Exchange.
      This copy is essentially my personal working copy, to which I may
      have added comments, small coding changes, and extra tests and examples.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MESH2D routines include a call to a function called wbar().
      The call to this function fails on my system, and since it
      seems to have no importance whatsoever, I commented it out.
      (I believe it is intended to generate a "wait bar", similar 
      to the hourglass or beachball or wristwatch icons.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MESH2D function "mytsearch()" was originally written to call
      MATLAB's "tsearch()" function.  The tsearch() function has since been
      removed from MATLAB.   Therefore, the call to tsearch() also
      causes MESH2D to fail!
    </p>

    <p>
      One alternative is a file called
      tsearch_mex.c, which searches a triangulation to determine which triangle
      contains each point.  It does not require that the triangulation be
      Delaunay.  To use this function with MATLAB, you need to apply MATLAB's
      MEX compiler...if you have never used the MEX compiler before, you may
      have some difficulty, since you need to determine that you have the MEX
      compiler, that you have a C or C++ compiler on your system, that MEX
      knows where these compilers are, and that you know how to invoke MEX
      to compile the function.  That should be something like
      <pre>
        mex tsearch_mex.c
      </pre>
      (The second time you do something like this is, of course, a hundred 
      times easier and only half as mysterious!)
    </p>

    <p>
      A second alternative is to replace the call to tsearch() by a 
      call to MATLAB's replacement function DelaunayTri; however, a simple
      substitution of one call for the other does not quite work.  There is,
      apparently, some feature of tsearch() that is not available in 
      DelaunayTri().  In particular, it may be that tsearch() did not require
      the triangulation to be Delaunay...
    </p>

    <p>
      A third alternative is to replace the call to tsearch(x,y,t,px,py) by a 
      call to tsearchn([x y], t, [px py] ), which seems to work.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
          [ <i>p, t</i> ] = <b>mesh2d</b> ( <i>vertices, edge, hdata, options</i> );
      </blockquote>
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>vertices</i>, required input, a V by 2 list of (X,Y) coordinates of
          vertices of the boundary.  If <i>vertices</i> is the only input argument,
          then it must be the case that the vertices are listed consecutively.
          Otherwise, assuming <i>edge</i> is supplied, the vertices can be given
          in any order.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>edge</i>, optional input, a V by 2 list of pairs of indices in the
          <i>vertices</i> array that constitute the edges of the polygonal boundary.
          If <i>vertices</i> is actually already in order, then <i>edge</i>, if
          specified, would contain the values [1,2; 2,3; 3,4; ... ; V,1].
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>, optional input, a structure containing element size information
          (see below).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>, optional input that allows the user to modify the default
          behavior of the solver (see below).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>p</i>, (output), an N by 2 list of node coordinates.  The number of
          nodes generated, N, is determined in part by the size of the edges
          along the boundary, and by other user input such as the maximum element
          size, and the user size function, if supplied.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>t</i>, (output), an M by 3 list of node indices, forming counterclockwise
          triangles.  The number of triangles created depends on the number of nodes
          created.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>hdata</b>, the element size information.  This structure, if supplied,
      can include the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>hmax</b>, the maximum allowable global element size.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>edgeh</b>, an array of element sizes on specified geometry
          edges, where <i>e1</i> is an index into the <i>edge</i> array.  The
          <b>edgeh</b> component would have the form [e1,h1; e2,h2; ...], where
          the user has specified a certain number of sizes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>fun</b>, the name of a function preceded by an AT sign,
          which is the user-defined size function.  <b>fun</b> must have the form
          <blockquote>
            h = fun ( x, y, args{} )
          </blockquote>
          where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are vectors of point coordinates, and <i>args</i>
          is an optional addition set of input set in <i>hdata</i>.<b>args</b>.
          The function returns the user-desired elementsize at the given points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>.<b>args</b> = {arg1, arg2, ...} contains additional arguments,
          if any, for <i>hdata</i>.<b>fun</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>options</b> allows the user to modify the default behavior of the solver.
      This structure, if supplied, can include the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>mlim</b> is the convergence tolerance. The maximum relative
          change in edge length per iteration must be less than this value, which
          defaults to 0.02.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>maxit</b>, the maximum allowable number of iterations,
          which defaults to 20.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>dhmax</b>, the maximum allowable (relative) gradient in the size 
          function, which defaults to 0.3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>.<b>output</b>, a "logical" variable which displays the mesh 
          and the mesh statistics upon completion, and defaults to "TRUE", that is, 1.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      such triangles will be split in half.  Remaining triangles will be untouched.
