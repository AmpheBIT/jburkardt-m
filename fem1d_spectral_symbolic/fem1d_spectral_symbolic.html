      FEM1D_SPECTRAL_SYMBOLIC <br> Spectral Finite Element Method for 1D problem, Symbolic Integration
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM1D_SPECTRAL_SYMBOLIC</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      applies the spectral finite element method to solve the problem
      u'' = - pi^2 sin(x) over [-1,+1] with zero boundary conditions,
      using as basis elements the functions x^n*(x-1)*(x+1),
      and carrying out the integration using MATLAB's symbolic toolbox,
      by Miro Stoyanov.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function solves the problem u'' = - pi^2 * sin( pi * x ) for x 
      in (-1,1), with boundary conditions u(-1) = u(1) = 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem has exact solution u(x) = sin(pi*x).
    </p>

    <p>
      We use the spectral finite element method.  We assume that the solution
      can be written in terms of polynomials:
      <pre>
        phi_1 = x^0     * (x-1)*(x+1),
        phi_2 = x^1     * (x-1)*(x+1)
        ...
        phi_i = x^(i-1) * (x-1)*(x+1) ...
      </pre>
      For this particular problem, the solution is an odd function, so only every
      other basis function will actually be useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB's symbolic toolbox is necessary for this program to run.
