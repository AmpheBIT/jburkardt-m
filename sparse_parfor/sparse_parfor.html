      SPARSE_PARFOR <br> Sample Construction of Sparse Matrix in Parallel
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_PARFOR</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      demonstrates how a sparse matrix can be constructed by
      evaluating individual blocks in parallel with the <b>parfor</b>
      command, and then assembled (on a single processor) using the 
      <b>sparse()</b> command.
    </p>

    <p>
      This script is a demonstration of how one can take advantage of
      MATLAB's parallel programming features when constructing a sparse
      matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      We construct a rectangular sparse matrix.  This matrix can be 
      thought of as a diagonal block matrix, with each diagonal block
      being of arbitrary size and shape.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, it is assumed that the computation of the individual
      matrix elements is expensive, and worth doing in parallel.
      </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, once the elements have been computed, the
      "sparse()" command is called on a single processor to "assemble"
      the computed matrix elements into a single MATLAB sparse matrix
      data structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem was posed by Vitor Nunes, 18 August 2011.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that there are many ways to set up a matrix, which
      seem reasonable, but which MATLAB's <b>parfor</b> command
      will not accept, because the matrix is not properly ``sliced''.
      By using cell arrays, this example is able to divide the problem
      into indexed segments (blocks) that the <b>parfor</b> and
      <b>sparse</b> commands can usefully process.
