      MEX <br> The MATLAB Compiler
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MEX</b>
      is the MATLAB compiler, which
      enables a user to design a MATLAB program which can call
      a function written in C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90,
      and to transmit information to and from such functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This facility means a user can design a program that
      combines features of multiple languages, or takes advantage
      of the fact that a useful function is already available in
      source code form.  Also, a user can take advantage of
      the interactive and graphic features of MATLAB in combination
      with calculations carried out in a traditional language.
    </p>

    <p>
      A particular reason to use MEX occurs when a highly efficient
      kernel or library has been written in a compilable language, but
      the user also needs the interactivity, graphics, or other features
      of MATLAB.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The C/C++/F77/F90 function can accept input, return values,
      and print data.  However, the function needs to communicate with
      MATLAB according to rules defined by the MEX compiler.  This means
      that things such as the data types of variables and the specific 
      form of commands to print data must be handled according to these
      rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the user function has been created, it can be compiled by the
      command "mex filename".  This will create compiled code that can be
      called directly by MATLAB.  For instance, the HELLO example includes
      a short C function called "hello.c".  Issuing the command "mex hello.c"
      invokes a C compiler that includes the necessary MATLAB libraries,
      and creates a compiled file called "hello.mexmaci64" (the extension
      indicates that I have compiled with MEX on a MACintosh computer using
      64 bit integer addressing).  MATLAB can invoke this compiled function
      by the command "hello".

      <b>HELLO</b> is the standard "Hello, world!" example.  It uses a
      function written in C.

        <li>
          <a href = "hello.c">hello.c</a>,
          the source code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "timestamp.m">timestamp.m</a>,
          prints the YMDHMS date as a timestamp.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "hello_test.m">hello_test.m</a>,
          a MATLAB script that combines the compilation of "hello.c"
          with an invocation of the "hello" command.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "hello_test_output.txt">hello_test_output.txt</a>,
