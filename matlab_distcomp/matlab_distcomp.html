      Distributed Computing with MATLAB
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_DISTCOMP</b>
      is a directory of information which
      discusses the use of distributed computing with MATLAB.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea of distributed computing is to take a single computing job
      and divide it into several tasks, each of which can be carried out
      independently.  These tasks may then be submitted together to some
      kind of scheduler or batch system, which can decide how and when (and
      perhaps where) to execute them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Distributed computing can occur <b>locally</b>, that is, on your
      desktop machine, particularly if it has multiple processors.  You can
      also do distributed computing <b>remotely</b>, for instance, on
      Virginia Tech's Ithaca cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the remote distributed computing case, you must first do a certain
      amount of preparation.  These steps are outlined in the document
      <a href = "../../pdf/matlab_remote_submission.pdf">
      "Notes on Enabling Remote Submission of MATLAB Jobs"</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enabling remote submission of jobs to the Ithaca cluster involves:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Setting up passwordless remote access to Ithaca from your machine.
          This is described in the document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copying some necessary files into the <b>toolbox/local</b> subdirectory
          of your copy of MATLAB.  These files are available in the
          <a href = "../../m_src/matlab_remote/matlab_remote.html">matlab_remote</a>
          directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copying a parallel configuration file  to
          your machine, installing it into MATLAB, and modifying it appropriately
          for your environment.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you think you've got your remote submission set up properly,
      you can test it by copying the GZIP'ed tar file from this directory,
      unzipping it, starting MATLAB, and issuing the command <b>test_all</b>.
