MD_PARALLEL
  MATLAB version

  A molecular dynamics program.

  NP, the number of particles is 1000.
  STEP_NUM, the number of time steps, is 500.
  DT, the time step size, is 0.000100 seconds.

  Initializing positions, velocities, and accelerations.

  Computing initial forces and energies.

  At each step, we report the potential and kinetic energies.
  The sum of these energies should be a constant.
  As an accuracy check, we also print the relative error
  in the total energy.
