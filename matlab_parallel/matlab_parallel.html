       Local Parallel Computing with MATLAB
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_PARALLEL</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how to do parallel computing with MATLAB on a single multicore or
      multiprocessor machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is called "local" parallel computing.  Local parallel computing
      with MATLAB requires access to MATLAB's <i>Parallel Computing Toolbox</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also possible to run a MATLAB program in parallel, taking advantage
      of a remote cluster of computers.  This is called "remote" parallel processing,
      and it requires, in addition to the Parallel Computing Toolbox, the
      <i>MATLAB Distributed Computing Server</i>.  Remote parallel computing will not
      be discussed in this article!
    </p>

    <p>
      You must be running a copy of MATLAB that is recent enough to have
      the parallel computing features described here.  In particular, you
      must be running MATLAB <b>version 2008a</b> or later.  (Sadly, you may
      find that MATLAB has stopped issuing new releases for your
      slightly old computer!)
    </p>

    <p>
      Your copy of MATLAB must include the Parallel Computing Toolbox.
      To get a list of <i>all</i> your toolboxes, type:
      <pre>
        ver
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming you have the right version of MATLAB, and the Parallel Computing Toolbox,
      let's also assume that your computer has multiple processors or cores.  If you
      don't, you can still run the Parallel Computing Toolbox - but you just won't
      ever see any speedup!
    </p>

      Local Parallel Computing
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you have access to the Parallel Computing Toolbox, then you can do "local"
      parallel computing directly on your machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose for a moment that you have a MATLAB M-file which has been modified
      to compute in parallel (we will explain what this means momentarily).
    <p>

    <p>
      The first thing you do, then, is to start up MATLAB in the regular way.
      This copy of MATLAB that you start with is called the "client" copy; the copies
      of MATLAB that will be created to assist in the computation
      are known as "workers".
    </p>

    <p>
      The process of running your program in parallel now requires three steps:
      <ul>
        <li>
          request a number of workers;
        </li>
        <li>
          issue the normal command to run the program.  The client program will
          call on the workers as needed;
        </li>
        <li>
          release the workers;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Supposing that your machine has 8 cores, and that your M file is named
      "samson.m", the command you might actually issue could look like this:
      <pre>
        matlabpool open local 4

        samson

        matlabpool close
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The number of workers you request can be any value from 0 up to 4.
      Of course, asking for 0 workers gets you no parallelism!  You can't ask for
      more than 4 because that's a limitation imposed by the Parallel Computing Toolbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is probably reasonable to request no more workers than you have cores on
      your machine.  If you only have 2 cores, and you ask for 4 workers,
      MATLAB will create 4 workers, but several of them will have to share each core.
   </p>

      Using the PARFOR Command for Parallel Programs
    </h3>

    <p>
      The simplest way of parallelizing a MATLAB program focuses on the
      <b>for</b> loops in the program.  If a <b>for</b> loop is suitable
      for parallel execution, this can be indicated simply by replacing the
      word <b>for</b> by the word <b>parfor</b>.  When the MATLAB program is
      run, and if workers have been made available by the <b>matlabpool</b>
      command, then the work in each <b>parfor</b> loop will be distributed
      among the workers.
    </p>

    <p>
      What determines whether a <b>for</b> loop is "suitable" for parallelization?
      The crucial question that must be answered satisfactorily is this:
      <i>Can the iterations of the loop be performed in any order without
      affecting the results?</I>  If the answer is "yes", then generally the
      loop can be parallelized.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have nested <b>for</b> loops, then generally it is not useful
      to replace these by nested <b>parfor</b> loops.  If the outer loop can
      be parallelized, then that is the one that should be controlled by a
      <b>parfor</b>.  If the outer loop cannot be parallelized, then you are
      free to try to parallelize some of the inner <b>for</b> loops.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Things you don't have to worry about:
    </h3>

    <p>
      In some parallelization systems, special care must be taken for
      what are called <i>reduction operations</i>.  Typically, these occur when
      certain functions such as the maximum, minimum, or sum, are applied
      to an indexed loop value.  MATLAB does not require any special treatment
      for such operations, and in general they are not an impediment to parallelization.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this loop, for example, the variables <b>total</b> and <b>big</b> are reduction
      variables.  MATLAB is able to handle this calculation in parallel without
      any special action from the user, who simply has to replace <b>for</b>
      by <b>parfor</b>:
      <pre>
        total = 0.0;
        big = - Inf;
        for i = 1 : n
          total = total + x(i);
          big = max ( big, x(i) );
        end
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Another feature of some parallelization systems involves the treatment
      of <i>temporary variables</i>.  In the simplest case, a temporary variable is
      a scalar that is redefined and then used within each iteration of a loop.
      It is often simply a convenience or shorthand for a cumbersome expression.
      Many parallelization systems require such variables to be declared
      as "private", so that each worker has its own copy of the variable.
      MATLAB does not require any such special treatment of temporary variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this loop, for example, the variable <b>angle</b> is a temporary
      variable.  MATLAB is able to handle this calculation in parallel without
      any special action from the user, who simply has to replace <b>for</b>
      by <b>parfor</b>:
      <pre>
        for i = 1 : n
          angle = ( i - 1 ) * pi / ( n - 1 );
          t(i) = cos ( angle );
        end
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Things you do have to worry about:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The most common programming practice that will make parallelization
      impossible occurs when the data used in one iteration of the loop
      is not available until a previous iteration has been computed.
      Sometimes there is another way of programming the loop that makes
      this difficulty disappear; other times, the problem cannot be fixed
      because the quantity being computed is inherently recursive.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a simple example, you may be computing the X locations of a set of
      nodes this way:
      <pre>
        dx = 0.25;
        x = zeros (1,n);
        for i = 2 : n
          x(i) = x(i-1) + dx;
        end
      </pre>
      It should be clear that MATLAB's approach to parallelization will fail
      if applied to this loop.  Correct computation requires that the iterations
      be done in exactly the order that the standard <b>for</b> specifies.
      However, it's not hard to see alternative ways of doing this calculation,
      such as:
      <pre>
        dx = 0.25;
        parfor i = 1 : n
          x(i) = (i-1) * dx;
        end
      </pre>
      (Of course, in this case, any MATLAB programmer can think of a one line
      solution, but that's not our point!)
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, suppose we are computing an approximation to the
      solution of a differential equation:
      <pre>
        dt = 0.25;
        u = zeros (1,n);
        for i = 2 : n
          u(i) = u(i-1) + dt * f( t, u(i-1) );
        end
      </pre>
      Here, there is generally no way to replace the sequential calculation
      by a parallel one.  The value of <b>u(i)</b> cannot be computed until
      the value of <b>u(i-1)</b> is known, and that means the loop iterations
      cannot be executed in arbitrary order.  Similar issues arise when a Newton
      iteration is being carried out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some loops include a <b>break</b> or <b>return</b> statement which
      is invoked if a certain condition is encountered.  Such loops cannot
      be parallelized!  Sometimes, the jump out of the loop was not actually
      necessary, but seemed more efficient, at least for sequential computation.
      It may be possible to execute the loop in parallel, at the cost of
      carrying out those "useless" final iterations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some temporary variables are used in ways that defeat parallelism.  This
      usually occurs when the value of the temporary variable is assumed to be
      saved from one iteration to the next, containing information that is necessary
      for the computation.  A simple example of this occurs when the variable is
      counting how many times some condition has occurred.  (There are often
      ways of rewriting the loop so that parallelization can occur.)
    </p>

    <p>
      In this loop, for example, we are looking for nonzero entries of the matrix A,
      and storing them in a compressed vector.  The variable <b>k</b>, which counts
      how many such entries we have seen so far, is a "wraparound" temporary,
      whose value, set in one loop iteration, is needed in a later loop iteration.
      It is not possible to ask MATLAB to carry out this operation in parallel
      simply by replacing the <b>for</b> loop by a <b>parfor</b>.  A better choice
      might be to explore the <b>find</b> command!
      <pre>
        k = 0;
        for i = 1 : m
          for j = 1 : n
            if ( a(i,j) ~= 0.0 )
              k = k + 1
              a2(k) = a(i,j);
              i2(k) = i;
              j2(k) = j;
            end
          end
        end
      </pre>
    </p>

      How to measure and report elapsed time
    </h3>

    <p>
      MATLAB's <b>cputime</b> function is designed to report the elapsed CPU time;
      but if your program is being run in parallel, this function might not capture
      the information you want.  That's because <b>cputime</b> will only measure
      the work done by the particular worker (or the client) that invokes it.
      In some cases, the client does very little work, and so a CPU time measurement
      will be very misleading.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, you should use the <b>tic</b> and <b>toc</b> functions to begin
      and end timing.  The call to <b>toc</b> returns the number of seconds elapsed
      since <b>tic</b> was called.
      Here is an example of the use of both <b>tic</b> and <b>toc</b>
      when measuring performance of a parallel computation.  Note that in this example,
      the parfor loops are not visible.  They occur inside the "compute" and "update"
      functions.
    </p>

    <pre>
  tic;

  for step = 1 : step_num

    [ force, potential, kinetic ] = compute ( np, nd, pos, vel, mass );

    pe(step) = potential;
    ke(step) = kinetic;
    ee(step) = ( potential + kinetic - e0 ) / e0;

    [ pos, vel, acc ] = update ( np, nd, pos, vel, force, acc, mass, dt );

  end

  wtime = toc;

  fprintf ( 1, '  Main computation:\n' );
  fprintf ( 1, '    Wall clock time = %f seconds.\n', wtime );
    </pre>
