      MD_PARFOR <br>
      A Parallel MATLAB Function Using PARFOR
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MD_PARFOR</b>
      is a directory which
      illustrates how a MATLAB function using the PARFOR statement
      can be run in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MATLAB program is a version of the MD molecular dynamics program.
      A single <b>for</b> statement in the <b>compute</b> function was replaced
      by a <b>parfor</b>.  Also, the program was simplified so that it takes
      no input arguments (the former input quantities are hard-coded internally)
      and returns three numbers as function results, namely the values, at the
      final time step, of the potential energy, kinetic energy, and the
      relative energy error.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the basic function now has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function [ pe, ke, e_lost ] = md_fun ( )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          pe, the potential energy at the final time step.
        </li>
        <li>
          ke, the kinetic energy at the final time step.
        </li>
        <li>
          e_lost, the relative error in the total energy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      and the function also prints out a summary table of these values
      every 50 time steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
