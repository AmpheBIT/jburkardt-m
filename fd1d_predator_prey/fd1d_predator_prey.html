    <p>
      <b>FD1D_PREDATOR_PREY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      uses finite
      difference methods for the dynamics of predator-prey interactions
      in 1 spatial dimension and time,
      by Marcus Garvey.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MATLAB code is mostly self explanatory, with the names of
      variables and parameters corresponding to the symbols used in 
      the finite difference methods described in the paper. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The code employs the sparse matrix facilities of MATLAB when solving
      the linear systems, which provides advantages in both matrix storage 
      and computation time. The code is <it>vectorized</it> to minimize the
      number of "for-loops" and conditional "if-then-else" statements, 
      which again helps speed up the computations. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The linear systems are solved using MATLAB's built in function
      <tt>lu.m</tt>.   We remark that a pure C or
      FORTRAN code is likely to be faster than our codes, but with the
      disadvantage of much greater complexity and length.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user is prompted for all the necessary parameters, time and
      space-steps, and initial data.  Due to a limitation in MATLAB, vector
      indices cannot be equal to zero; thus the nodal indices
      <tt>0,...,J</tt> are shifted up one unit to give <tt>1,...,(J+1)</tt>
      so <b>x<sub>i</sub>=(i-1)*h + a</b>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is structured as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lines 4-12: User prompted for model parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines 14-15: User prompted for initial data as a string
          (allowable formats discussed below).
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines 17-20: Calculation of some constants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines 22-25: Initialization of matrices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines 27-29: Initial data assigned numerically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines 31-38: Assembly of matrices <b>L</b>, <b>B<sub>1</sub></b>, 
          and <b>B<sub>2</sub></b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines 40-41: LU factorization of <b>B<sub>1</sub></b> and
          <b>B<sub>2</sub></b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines 43-59: Solving the linear system repeatedly up-to time 
          level <b>t<sub>N</sub>=T</b> using forward and backward substitution. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 61: Numerical solution plotted for <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> at 
          time <b>T</b>. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial data functions are entered by the user as a string, which 
      can take several different formats. Functions are evaluated on an 
      element by element basis, where <b>x=(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>J+1</sub>)</b>
      is a vector of grid points, and so a "." must precede each arithmetic
      operation between vectors.  The exception to this rule is when applying
      MATLAB's intrinsic functions where there is no ambiguity.  Some arbitrary
      examples with an acceptable format include the following:
      <pre>
        >> Enter initial prey function u0(x)  <b>0.2*exp(-(x-100).^2)</b>
        >> Enter initial predator function v0(x)  <b>0.4*x./(1+x)</b>
      </pre>
      or,
      <pre>
        >> Enter initial prey function u0(x)  <b>0.3+(x-1200).*(x-2800)</b>
        >> Enter initial predator function v0(x)  <b>0.4</b>
      </pre>
      This last example shows that for a constant solution vector we need
      only enter a single number. It is also possible to enter functions 
      that are piecewise defined by utilizing MATLAB's logical operators
      <b>&</b>, ('AND'), <b>|</b>, ('OR'), and <b>~</b> (`NOT'), applied to
      matrices. For example, on a domain <b>Omega=[0,200]</b>, to choose 
      an initial prey density that is equal to 0.4 for 
      90&lt;=x<sub>i</sub>&lt;=110, and equal to 0.1 otherwise, the user inputs:
      <pre>
        >> Enter initial prey function u0(x)  0.4*((x>90)&(x<110))+0.1*((x<=90)|(x>=110))
      </pre>
