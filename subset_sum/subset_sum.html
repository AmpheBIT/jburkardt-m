      SUBSET_SUM <br> The Subset Sum Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUBSET_SUM</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      seeks solutions of the subset sum problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function tries to compute a target value as the sum of
      a selected subset of a given set of weights.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function works by brute force, that is, it tries every
      possible subset to see if it sums to the desired value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given N weights, every possible selection can be described by
      one of the N-digit binary numbers from 0 to 2^N-1.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function includes a range, which allows the user to
      control which subsets are to be checked.  Thus, if there are
      N weights, specifying a range of [ 0, 2^N-1] indicates that
      all subsets should be checked.  On the other hand, this full
      range could be broken down into smaller subranges, each of
      which could be checked independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible that, in the given range, there may be multiple
      solutions of the problem.  This function will only return
      one such solution, if found.  However, the function may be called
      again, with an appropriate restriction of the range, to continue
      the search for other solutions.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        [ <i>c</i>, <i>index</i> ] = <b>subset_sum</b> ( <i>w</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>r</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>w</i>, a set of N weights.  N must be no more than 31.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>t</i>, the target value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>r</i>, a vector of length 2, containing the lower and upper
          limits to be searched.  To search the entire range, use [ 0, 2^N-1].
          This argument is optional, and if omitted, the full range is searched.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>c</i>, a vector containing the indices of the weights used to
          make the combination.  This array is empty if no solution was found.
          Otherwise, the list of weights used to form the sum is <i>w(c)</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>index</i>, the index, between <i>r(1)</i> and <i>r(2)</i>, of the solution
          that was found, or an empty value if no solution was found.
          If a solution was found, you might call again for further solutions
          in the unchecked portion of the range, using the range
          [ <i>i+1</i>, <i>r(2)</i> ].
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <pre>
        w = [ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ];
        t = 22;
        r = [ 0, 2^6 - 1 ];

        [ c, index ] = subset_sum ( w, t, r )

        c = [ 2, 3, 5 ]
        index = 22
        ( the binary representation of 22 is 010110 )
      </pre>
