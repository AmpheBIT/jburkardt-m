      Steady Incompressible Navier Stokes Equations in 2D <br>
      Finite Element Solution <br>
      Banded Storage
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_NAVIER_STOKES</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      applies the finite element
      method to solve, over an arbitrary triangulated region,
      a discretized version of the nonlinear partial differential
      equations for steady incompressible Navier Stokes flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The geometry is entirely external to the program.  The user
      specifies one file of nodal coordinates, and one file that
      describes the triangles in terms of six node coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program makes a default assumption that all boundary velocities
      correspond to Dirichlet boundary conditions, and that one pressure
      is specified (for uniqueness of the pressure system).  The user
      can adjust these boundary conditions (and even specify Dirichlet
      constraints on any variable at any node) by setting the appropriate
      data in certain user routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>At the moment, Neumann conditions, if specified, must have a
      zero right hand side.  The machinery to integrate a nonzero
      Neumann condition has not been set up yet.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      The linear system is created and stored using a
      form of the LINPACK/LAPACK "general band" storage.  The system
      is factored and solved using general band factorization and solution
      routines similar to LINPACK's DGBFA and DGBSL routines.
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      Computational Region
    </h2>

    <p>
      The computational region is initially unknown by the program.  The user
      specifies it by preparing a file containing the coordinates of
      the nodes, and a file containing the indices of nodes that make
      up triangles that form a triangulation of the region.  For the
      following ridiculously small example:
      <pre>
       10-11-12
        |\    |\
        | \   | \
        6  7  8  9
        |   \ |   \
        |    \|    \
        1--2--3--4--5
      </pre>
      the node file could be:
      <pre>
         0.0 0.0
         1.0 0.0
         2.0 0.0
         3.0 0.0
         0.0 1.0
         1.0 1.0
         2.0 1.0
         3.0 1.0
         0.0 2.0
         1.0 2.0
         2.0 2.0
      </pre>
      and the triangle file would be
      <pre>
         1  3  10  2  7  6
        12 10  3  11  7  8
         3  5 12   4  9  8
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      The Navier Stokes Equations
    </h2>

    <p>
      The state variables are a velocity vector (U,V)(X,Y) and a scalar
      pressure P(X,Y).  The state variables are constrained by the
      momentum and continuity equations, which apply inside the region:
      <pre>
        - nu * (Uxx + Uxx) + U * dU/dx + V * dU/dy + dP/dx  = u_rhs(x,y)

        - nu * (Vxx + Vyy) + U * dV/dx + V * dV/dy + dP/dy  = v_rhs(x,y)

        dU/dx + dV/dy = p_rhs(x,y)
      </pre>
      where, typically, the right hand side functions are zero.  However,
      the user is free to assign nonzero values to these functions
      through a user routine.
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      Boundary Conditions
    </h2>

    <p>
      At every point on the boundary of the region, the program assumes
      that both components of the velocity are specified.
      <pre><b>
        U(node) = U_BC(node)
        V(node) = V_BC(node)
      </b></pre>
      This is known as a "Dirichlet boundary condition".  The right hand side
      of the boundary condition is left unspecified until the user
      routine is called.  If a wall is intended, then the appropriate
      condition has U_BC and V_BC zero.  An inlet might have a
      particular flow profile function used to assign nonzero values.
    </p>

    <p>
      At one point in the region, the program assumes
      that the value of the pressure is specified.
      <pre><b>
        P(node) = P_BC(node)
      </b></pre>
      Such a condition must be supplied; otherwise the pressure cannot
      be uniquely determined, since it is essentially a potential function,
      and so is unique only "up to a constant".  Note that the program allows
      the user to specify pressure conditions anyway, and these can be
      of Dirichlet or Neumann type.  In general, however, this is not
      a physically or mathematically or computationally good thing to do!
    </p>

    <p>
      The user routine <b>boundary_type</b> can be used to modify the
      type of the boundary conditions associated with a degree of freedom
      at a boundary node - or even to add constraints to variables
      associated with nodes in the interior.
    </p>

    <p>
      One choice that the user can make is to reset certain boundary
      conditions to be of Neumann type:
      <pre><b>
        dU/dn(node) = U_BC(node)
        dV/dn(node) = V_BC(node)
      </b></pre>
      The right hand side of the boundary condition is left unspecified
      until the user routine is called.  As mentioned earlier, the program
      cannot currently handle Neumann conditions with nonzero right hand side.
      (A nonzero value is simply ignored, but won't actually cause the
      program to fail.)
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      Computational Procedure
    </h2>

    <p>
      We use linear finite elements for the pressure function, and to
      generate these, we only need the nodes that are the vertices of
      the triangles.  (We will call these vertices "pressure nodes.")
      Because quadratic basis functions are to be used
      for the velocity, however, each triangle will also have three extra
      midside nodes available for that.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now assume that the unknown velocity component functions U(x,y)
      and V(x,y) can be represented as linear combinations of the quadratic
      basis functions associated with each node, and that the scalar
      pressure P(x,y) can be represented as a linear combination of the linear
      basis functions associated with each pressure node.
    </p>

    <p>
      For every node, we can determine a quadratic velocity basis function
      PSI(I)(x,y).  For every pressure node I, we can determine a linear
      basis function PHI(I)(x,y).  If we assume that our solutions are linear
      combinations of these basis functions, then we need to solve for
      the coefficients.
    </p>

    <p>
      To do so, we apply the Galerkin-Petrov method.  For each pressure
      node, and its corresponding basis function PHI(I), we generate a
      copy of the continuity equation, multiplied by that basis function,
      and integrated over the region:
      <blockquote>
        Integral ( dUdx(x,y) + dVdy(x,y) ) * PHI(I)(x,y) dx dy =
        Integral ( P_RHS(x,y) * PHI(I)(x,y) dx dy )
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, for each node and its corresponding velocity basis function
      PSI(I), we generate two copies of the momentum equation, one for
      each component.  We multiply by PSI(I), integrate over the region,
      and use integration by parts to lower the order of differentiation.
      This gives us:
      <blockquote>
        Integral ( nu * ( dPSIdx(I) * dUdx + dPSIdy(I) * dUdy )
          + PSI(I) * ( ( U * dUdx + V * dUdy ) + dPdx - U_RHS ) dx dy ) = 0
        <br>
        Integral ( nu * ( dPSIdx(I) * dVdx + dPSIdy(I) * dVdy )
          + PSI(I) * ( ( U * dVdx + V * dVdy ) + dPdy - V_RHS ) dx dy ) = 0
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      After adjusting for the boundary conditions, the set of all such
      equations yields a nonlinear system for the coefficients of the
      finite element representation of the solution.  To solve such
      a nonlinear system, we apply Newton's method.  This means we
      must have a starting solution.  For starting solution, we
      solve the (linear) Stokes problem first.  The value of this
      initial approximate solution is printed out, since the Stokes
      solution is of interest in its own right.  Then the Newton iteration
      is applied to determine the solution of the nonlinear system.

      User Input Routines
    </h2>

    <p>
      The program requires the user to supply the following routines:
    </p>

    <p>
      The default boundary condition types are passed to the user, along
      with other information.  The user modifies any data as necessary, and
      returns it.  This is done by a user-supplied MATLAB M file of the form:
      <blockquote><b>
        function [ node_u_condition, node_v_condition, node_p_condition ] =
          boundary_type ( node_num, node_xy, node_boundary, node_type,
          node_u_condition, node_v_condition, node_p_condition )
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The value of the kinematic viscosity is
      determined by a user-supplied MATLAB M file of the form
      <blockquote><b>
        function nu = constants ( )
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The right hand side of any Dirichlet boundary conditions are
      determined by a user-supplied MATLAB M file of the form
      <blockquote><b>
        function [ u_bc, v_bc, p_bc ] = dirichlet_condition ( n, xy )
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The right hand side of any Neumann boundary conditions are
      determined by a user-supplied MATLAB M file of the form
      <blockquote><b>
        function [ u_bc, v_bc, p_bc ] = neumann_condition ( n, xy )
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The right hand side source term functions are determined by
      a user-supplied MATLAB M file of the form
      <blockquote><b>
        function [ u_rhs, v_rhs, p_rhs ] = rhs ( m, xy )
      </b></blockquote>
