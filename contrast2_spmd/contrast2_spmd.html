      CONTRAST2_SPMD <br> SPMD Workers Cooperate on Image Processing
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CONTRAST2_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the <b>SPMD</b> (single program, multiple data) command
      so that multiple MATLAB workers can cooperate in an
      image processing task.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is an improvement on the contrast_spmd code.  That code
      left white bars on the processed image, because each worker had to treat its
      first and last columns as boundaries.  This improved code demonstrates how
      workers can communicate with MPI-style messages.  In this way, two workers
      can exchange image columns needed to avoid the artificial boundary effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function y = contrast2_fun ( x )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          x is a 2 dimensional array containing a black and white image;
        </li>
        <li>
          y is a 2 dimensional array containing a version of the image in which
          the contrast has been enhanced.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
