      FEM2D_HEAT_RECTANGLE_STEADY_SPMD <br> Codistributed Array Example for Parallel Computing Toolbox
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_HEAT_RECTANGLE_STEADY_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      demonstrates how the linear system associated with a finite element problem
      can be treated as a codistributed array whose entries are assigned to different
      MATLAB workers, so that the matrix is assembled in parallel,
      by Gene Cliff.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program produces an approximate (steady-state) solution to a heat equation
      on a rectangular domain.  The code uses
      the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox's Single Program Multiple Data (spmd) mode.
      A matrix assembly step is carried out by the <i>assemb_co.m</i> code.  It contains
      a line that invokes the spmd mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      Problem data are given in  <i>p_data.m</i>.  In particular, the grid parameters are given by:
      <pre>
        param.nodesx =   51; % (=nx)
        param.nodesy =   51; % (=ny)
      </pre>
      There will be nx*ny unknowns, and (nx-1)*(ny-1)/2 triangular elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code uses the ILU preconditioner and the GMRES solver to solve the linear system.
      These routines are currently not 'overloaded' for codistributed arrays, so we 'gather'
      the required arrays on lab #1.  We expect that GMRES (at least) will be overloaded
      to handle codistributed arrays in upcoming releases of the software.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code produces a collection of ASCII text files (outj, one for each lab).
      These files contain brief information about the columns of an FEM matrix assembled
      on that lab, and on what fraction of the elements were evaluated.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code uses the 'backslash' operator \ (mldivide or matrix-left-divide) on
      codistributed array(s).  Unfortunately, while mldivide has been overloaded for
      codistributed arrays, it is not (yet ?) available for arrays with the 'sparse'
      attribute.  Thus, the arrays are converted to 'full' before the solve step(s).
    <p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function zz_ss = fem2d_fun ( param )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          param is a structure containing problem parameters;
        </li>
        <li>
          zz_ss is a vector containing the solution; it must be reshaped
          to a 2D array before plotting.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
