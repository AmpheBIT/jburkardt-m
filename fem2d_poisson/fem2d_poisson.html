      FEM2D_POISSON <br> Finite Element Solution on an Arbitrary 2D Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_POISSON</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      applies the finite element method to solve
      a form of Poisson's equation over an arbitrary triangulated region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The linear system is stored using the LINPACK general band format,
      and solved using routines derived from LINPACK.  (For this reason,
      you should probably use the program FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE instead!)
    </p>

    <p>
      The geometry is entirely external to the program.  The user
      specifies one file of nodal coordinates, and one file that
      describes the triangles in terms of six node coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program makes a default assumption that all boundary conditions
      correspond to Dirichlet boundary conditions.  The user
      can adjust these boundary conditions (and even specify Dirichlet
      constraints on any variable at any node) by setting the appropriate
      data in certain user routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>At the moment, Neumann conditions, if specified, must have a
      zero right hand side.  The machinery to integrate a nonzero
      Neumann condition has not been set up yet.</i>
    </p>

    <h2 align = "center">
      Computational Region
    </h2>

    <p>
      The computational region is unknown by the program.  The user
      specifies it by preparing a file containing the coordinates of
      the nodes, and a file containing the indices of nodes that make
      up triangles that form a triangulation of the region.  For the
      following ridiculously small example:
      <pre>
        4----5
        |\   |\
        | \  | \
        |  \ |  \
        |   \|   \
        1----2----3
      </pre>
      the node file would be:
      <pre>
         0.0 0.0
         1.0 0.0
         2.0 0.0
         0.0 1.0
         1.0 1.0
      </pre>
      and the triangle file would be
      <pre>
        1 2 4
        5 4 2
        2 3 5
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is set up to handle the linear Poisson
      equation with a right hand side function, and nonhomogeneous
      Dirichlet boundary conditions.   The state variable
      U(X,Y) is then constrained by:
      <pre>
        - Del H(x,y) Del U(x,y) + K(x,y) * U(x,y) = F(x,y)  inside the region;
                                           U(x,y) = G(x,y)  on the boundary.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To specify the right hand side function F(x,y), the coefficient functions
      H(x,y) and K(x,y) and the boundary condition function G(x,y),
      the user has to supply routines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>function value = rhs ( x, y )</b> evaluates F(x,y);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>function value = h_coef ( x, y )</b> evaluates H(x,y);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>function value = k_coef ( x, y )</b> evaluates K(x,y);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>function value = dirichlet_condition ( x, y )</b> evaluates G(X,Y),
          and is only called at nodes on the boundary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <p>
      The program writes out a file containing an Encapsulated
      PostScript image of the nodes and elements, with numbers.
      If there are a lot of nodes, the plot may be too cluttered
      to read.  For lower values, however, it is
      a valuable map of what is going on in the geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is also able to write out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.
