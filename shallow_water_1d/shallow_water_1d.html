      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "make_animation.m">make_animation.m</a>,
          a script that calls shallow_water_1d to compute the data arrays,
          and then shallow_water_1d_animation to create a sequence of JPG image files.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "shallow_water_1d_animation.m">shallow_water_1d_animation.m</a>,
          a program to animate the solution by creating a series of JPEG files.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple dataset was created by the command
      <pre>
        [ h_array, uh_array, x, t ] = shallow_water_1d ( 41, 100, 1.0, 0.2, 9.8 )
      </pre>
      This was then animated by the command
      <pre>
        shallow_water_1d_animation ( h_array, uh_array, x, t )
      </pre>
      and the resulting JPG files were turned into QuickTime movies.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "h_reflective.mov">h_reflective.mov</a>,
          a QuickTime movie of H for 101 steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "uh_reflective.mov">uh_reflective.mov</a>,
          a QuickTime movie of UH for 101 steps.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      An internal switch was modified so that the code used periodic boundary
      conditions.  In this case, we can expect momentum conservation.  
      The dataset was created by the command
      <pre>
        [ h_array, uh_array, x, t ] = shallow_water_1d ( 41, 100, 1.0, 0.2, 9.8 )
      </pre>
      This was then animated by the command
      <pre>
        shallow_water_1d_animation ( h_array, uh_array, x, t )
      </pre>
      and the resulting JPG files were turned into QuickTime movies.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "h_periodic.mov">h_periodic.mov</a>,
          a QuickTime movie of H for 101 steps.
