      HELLO <br> A MATLAB program to say "Hello, world!"
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HELLO</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      says "Hello, world!".
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're just trying to learn MATLAB, or learning how to use
      MATLAB on a different computer system, or in batch mode, it's helpful
      if you start with a very simple program with a tiny amount of output
      that should print immediately if things are working well.
    </p>

    <p>
      One issue that MATLAB users need to resolve on a new system is
      making sure that the M-file containing their program is "visible" to
      MATLAB.  As far as the HELLO program goes, this means that you want to
      be able to type "hello" and have MATLAB know that it should find the
      file "hello.m" and run it.  You can either do this by using the <b>cd</b>
      command inside of MATLAB to move the current directory to the directory
      containing hello.m, or you can try to add that directory to MATLAB's path.
      The second option can be done by going to MATLAB's FILE menu, choosing
      "Set Path..." and the on the new menu choosing "Add directory..." which
      will put you into an interactive browser that will let you find and
      identify the directory where your command file is.
