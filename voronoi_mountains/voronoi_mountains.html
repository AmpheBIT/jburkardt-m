    <p>
      <b>VORONOI_MOUNTAINS</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      makes a 3D surface plot of a Voronoi diagram.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Voronoi diagram divides up points in the plane by associating
      each point with the closest of a set of generator points.  This
      process partitions the plane into polygonal regions.  If we then
      associate with each point (X,Y) the distance Z(X,Y) to the nearest
      generator, then the corresponding surface is made by patching
      together parts of cones.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we flip this surface over, the generators become the "peaks"
      of a chain of mountains; the lines of the Voronoi diagram become
      the bottoms of valleys, which are straight in the XY plane,
      although their height varies parabolically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using MATLAB's 3D plotting features, including the 3D rotation
      and zoom, it is possible to examine such a plot and gain a
      better understanding of some of the features of a Voronoi diagram.
