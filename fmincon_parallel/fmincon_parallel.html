      FMINCON_PARALLEL <br> Minimization via FMINCON and the Parallel Computing Toolbox
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FMINCON_PARALLEL</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      demonstrates how the FMINCON function, which is used to find the
      constrained minimizer of a function, can use
      MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox to perform some calculations in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program transcribes a (class of) optimal control problem(s) to finite-dimensional
      nonlinear programming problems and then invokes the Matlab solver fmincon.
      The problem has a fixed initial state, a fixed terminal time, a Mayer cost
      functional and a scalar-valued control function.  Data for a specific problem
      are supplied by the user; <i>zermelo.m</i> is an example based on efficient
      navigation of a boat in a spatially varying current.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>run_opt</b> ( <i>'function_file'</i>, <i>intervals</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'function_file'</i> is a string that identifies a user supplied
          function that returns a data structure with the problem specification
          (see the example <i>zermelo.m</i>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>intervals</i> is a positive integer that specifies a number of
          uniform intervals of the time axis interval [ 0, PAR.tf].
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The user must supply certain routines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          PAR.rhs, for evaluating the dynamics;
        </li>
        <li>
          PAR.cost, for the Mayer cost functional;
        </li>
        <li>
          PAR.eq, PAR.ineq, for any terminal constraints;
        </li>
      </ul>
      as well as PAR.x0, the initial condition for the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user may also supply optional routines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          PAR.plot, for plotting;
        </li>
        <li>
          PAR.initial_guess, an initial estimate for the control values;
        </li>
        <li>
          PAR.ub, PAR.lb, bounds for the controls.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      No error checking is done to ensure that the specified problem data are consistent.
      Strange error messages may result from such inconsistency (e.g. the dimension of the
      state - the 'size' of the returned output from PAR.rhs  - must be same as the 'size'
      of PAR.x0, and the same as the 'size' of the input arguments to PAR.cost, PAR.eq,
      and PAR.ineq).
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the code with the sample problem, the command might be
      <blockquote>
        <b>run_opt</b> ( 'zermelo.m', 16 )
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the code with the sample problem and the Parallel Computing Toolbox,
      the command might be
      <blockquote>
        matlabpool open local 4<br>
        <b>run_opt</b> ( 'zermelo.m', 16 )<br>
        matlabpool close
      </blockquote>
      where, in this case, we have only asked for 4 MATLAB workers.
      Assuming successful convergence, plots showing the path of the boat in the plane
      and a time history of the piecewise constant controlm will be displayed.
