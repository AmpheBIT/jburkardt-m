      DICE_SIMULATION <br> Simulation of a Dice Game
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DICE_SIMULATION</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      simulates N games in which M dice are thrown and summed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user specifies the number of games (throws of the dice) and
      the number of dice.  The program plots a histogram or bar chart
      of the number of times each score was attained, an estimated probability
      chart (simply normalizing the frequencies), as well as the
      average and variance of the scores.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, for 1 die, we expect the histogram to be roughly uniform,
      for 2 dice, it should have a pyramidal shape, and for higher numbers of
      dice, the frequency plot should suggest the normal curve.

      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>throws</i> is the number of times the dice are thrown.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>dice</i> is the number of dice.
