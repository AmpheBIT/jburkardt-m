>> cpu_timing ( 1000 )

CPU_TIMING:
  MATLAB has a built in command called CPUTIME,
  which measures the CPU time elapsed so far.
  The difference of two readings measures the work done lately.

TASK #1:
  Multiply two random dense matices of order N
  using MATLAB's A*B operation.

  MegaFLOPs = 1000
  Elapsed CPU time  = 0.790000
  Rate  = 1265.822785

TASK #2:
  Multiply two random dense matices of order N
  using explicit loops.

  MegaFLOPs = 1000
  Elapsed CPU time  = 242.650000
  Rate  = 4.121162
