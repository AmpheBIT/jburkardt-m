      MGS <br> An Example of Legacy Code
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MGS</b> is intended to embody the problem of "legacy code", that
      is, software that is useful, but out of date, not documented, not
      well understood, and in need of some new features.
    </p>

    <p>
      When approaching legacy software, it's useful to try to come up
      with good documentation for what the program is doing, a set of
      test problems which must be correctly handled by any new version
      of the software, and a set of timing problems that can show
      whether changes to the software have improved its efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case, the student is challenged to make a copy of the source
      code, read it, try to work out what it is doing, document it, and come
      up with a nice set of examples illustrating what is going on.  A student
      might also be interested in the task of creating an equivalent version
      in a different language, and then demonstrating that the two programs
      produce the same results.
