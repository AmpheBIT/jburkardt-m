      SATISFY_PARFOR <br> A Parallel MATLAB Function Using PARFOR
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SATISFY_PARFOR</b>
      is a directory which
      illustrates how a MATLAB function using the PARFOR statement
      can be run in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem assumes that we are given a logical circuit of AND, OR and NOT
      gates, with N=23 binary inputs and a single output.  We are to determine all
      inputs which produce a 1 as the output.
    </p>

    <p>
      The general problem is NP complete, so there is no known polynomial-time
      algorithm to solve the general case.  The natural way to search for solutions
      then is exhaustive search of all 2^N possible inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an interesting way, this is a very extreme and discrete version of
      the problem of maximizing a scalar function of multiple variables.
      The difference is that here we know that both the input and output
      only have the values 0 and 1, rather than a continuous range of real
      values!
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem is a natural candidate for parallel computation, since
      the individual evaluations of the circuit are completely independent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Virginia Tech Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The basic calculation is performed by <b>satisfy_fun</b> and has the form:
      <blockquote>
        <i>solutions</i> = <b>satisfy_fun</b> ( )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>solutions</i> is a <i>solution_num</i> by <i>n</i> array,
          containing the solutions that were found.  Each row is a
          sequence of 0's and 1's indicating an assignment of the variables
          that makes the formula true.
        </li>
      </ul>
