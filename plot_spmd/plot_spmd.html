    <p>
      <b>PLOT_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the <b>SPMD</b> (single program, multiple data) command to
      create the data for a plot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function [ X, Y ] = plot_fun ( )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          X and Y are Nx100 arrays, containing sections of the plot computed
          by each of the N workers.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
