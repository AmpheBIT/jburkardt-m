      IMAGE_DENOISE_SPMD <br> SPMD Labs Cooperate to Make a Plot
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_DENOISE_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the <b>SPMD</b> (single program, multiple data) command
      so that multiple MATLAB workers or "labs" can cooperate in an
      image processing task.
    </p>

    <p>
      An image can be read into MATLAB using the <b>imread</b> function
      in the Image Processing Toolbox.  Many image processing operations
      can be broken up among cooperating processors.  Using the <b>spmd</b>
      command, this is done most naturally by distributing the image, so
      that each worker gets a separate section.  Once the processing is complete,
      the client copy of MATLAB can reassemble the image.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example considered here, a good image is damaged by the addition of
      "salt and pepper"  noise; that is, individual pixels have been randomly modified.
      The result looks unrecognizable, but there is still a great deal of the original
      information.  The approach is to split the color image into R, G and B planes,
      and to average the color information locally over each plane.  In this way,
      lone error pixels will tend to get blended away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function [ x, y, z ] = image_fun ( )
      </blockquote>
      where the original image, "balloons.tif", is read by the function, and
      <ul>
        <li>
          x is an array containing the original image;
        </li>
        <li>
          y is an array containing the noisy image;
        </li>
        <li>
          z is an array containing the filtered image;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
