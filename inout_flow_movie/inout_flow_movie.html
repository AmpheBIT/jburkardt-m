      INOUT_FLOW_MOVIE <br> Flow Animation for the INOUT Cell
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>INOUT_FLOW_MOVIE</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      creates an animation of the velocity solutions to a time-dependent
      incompressible parameterized flow problem in a cell with
      inflow and outflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "INOUT" region is contained in the unit square, [0,1] x [0,1].
      There is an inlet on the left side, from [0,0] to [0,0.2], and an
      outlet on the right side, from [1,0.8] to [1.0,1.0].

      There are 1,681 nodes in a 41 by 41 evenly spaced grid.  The nodes
      are organized into 800 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure.
