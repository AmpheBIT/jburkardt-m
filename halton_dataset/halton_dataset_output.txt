HALTON_DATASET (MATLAB version)
  Generate a Halton dataset.

  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * NDIM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * STEP, the index of the first subsequence element.
  * SEED(1:NDIM), the Halton sequence element
    corresponding to STEP = 0
  * LEAP(1:NDIM), the successive jumps in the
    Halton sequence.
  * BASE(1:M), the Halton bases,
    usually distinct primes.

  The program generates the data, writes it to the file

    halton_NDIM_N.txt

  where "NDIM" and "N" are the numeric values specified
  by the user, and then asks the user for more input.

  To indicate that no further computations are 
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value, 
  such as -1.

  NDIM is the spatial dimension.
  Any value less than 1 terminates execution.
  Enter NDIM:  2
  User input NDIM = 2

  N is the number of points.
  Any value less than 1 terminates execution.
  Enter N:  10
  User input N = 10

  STEP is the index of the first subsequence element.
  Any value less than 0 terminates execution.
  Enter STEP:  0
  User input STEP = 0

  SEED(1:NDIM) is the starting element index
  for each coordinate.
  [0, 0, ..., 0] is a common choice.
  (Any value less than 0 terminates execution.)
  Enter SEED(1:NDIM):  [1,1]

SEED:           1           1

  LEAP(1:NDIM) is the leaping multiplier
  for each coordinate.
  [1, 1, ..., 1] is a common choice.
  Another is any prime bigger than all the bases.
  (Any value less than 1 terminates execution.)
  Enter LEAP(1:NDIM):  [1,1]

LEAP:           1           1

  BASE(1:NDIM) is the base for each coordinate,
  usually distinct primes.
  [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... ] is a common choice.
  (Any value less than 2 terminates execution.)
  Enter BASE:  [2,3]

BASE:           2           3

  The Halton data was written to the file "halton_2_10.txt".
