      IMAGE_EDGE <br> Edge Detection in Images
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_EDGE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      demonstrates the detection of edges in an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      NEWS is a particularly simple edge detection scheme, which compares
      the North, East, West, and South neighbors of a pixel to determine
      if the pixel lies along an edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many sophisticated edge detection algorithms, and MATLAB
      has many of them built into its image processing toolbox.  The purpose
      of these examples is simply to demonstrate how a simple version of
      such edge detection schemes works.

          <a href = "coins_news3.png">coins_news3.png</a>,

          image4 uses a threshold.  Values below the threshold are set to
          0 (black), and values above are set to the maximum (white).

        <li>
          <a href = "coins_news5.png">coins_news5.png</a>,
          is the same as image 4, but in "reverse video".  It is easier
