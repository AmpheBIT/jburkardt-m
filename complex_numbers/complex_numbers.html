      COMPLEX_NUMBERS <br> Complex Numbers in MATLAB Programming
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COMPLEX_NUMBERS</b> is a MATLAB program which
      demonstrates very briefly some of the features of using complex
      numbers in a MATLAB program. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first issue is how to declare a complex variable, including
      the choice of single precision or double precision, whether
      the variable is a scalar, vector, or array, and whether the variable
      is initialized with a value, or assigned one.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second issue concerns the question of how a complex variable is
      to be printed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns how a complex variable is to operated on
      by the arithmetic operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      division, and exponentiation.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The language also provides a number of intrinsic functions that
      can be applied to a complex variable.  The names of these functions
      can sometimes be easy to forget.  Moreover, it is occasionally true
      that there may be a selection of functions with similar names
      (say, "exp", "cexp" and "dcexp") which may or may not produce the
      desired results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns the details of double precision calculation.
      Even a single accidental use of a single precision function name
      in a double precision computation can result in the loss of half
      the digits of accuracy.  Thus, it sometimes really matters whether
      you use "cmplx" or "dcmplx" to assign values to a double precision
      complex variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      One peculiar feature of MATLAB is that the symbols <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>
      are predefined as functions that return the value of the complex unit.
      Unless the user redefines them (for example, by using a <b>for</b>
      statement in which <b>i</b> is an index) then they can be used to
      set up complex quantities:
      <pre>
        a = 1 + 2 * i;
        b = 1 + 2 * j;
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Another peculiar feature of MATLAB is that the <b>printf</b> command
      will only print the real part of a complex number.  To get the real
      and imaginary parts, you must explicitly request them:
      <pre>
        a = 1 + 2 * i;
        fprintf ( 1, '  %f  %f\n', a );  <-- not correct!
        fprintf ( 1, '  %f  %f\n', real ( a ), imag ( a ) );  <--correct!
      </pre>
    </p>
