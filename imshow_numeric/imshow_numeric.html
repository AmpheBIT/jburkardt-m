      IMSHOW_NUMERIC <br> Display a Numeric Array as a Grayscale Image
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMSHOW_NUMERIC</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      displays a numeric array as a grayscale image.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox works with images stored as 2D or 3D arrays
      of a special type, typically "uint8", that is, an unsigned 8 bit integer whose
      values are between 0 and 255.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many image processing algorithms require numeric operations on real data
      (which MATLAB typically types as "double", and return values with fractional
      parts, in arbitrary ranges that might include negative values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, if one wants to carry out simple numeric versions of image processing
      algorithms, one must repeatedly convert numeric data to image data to view it
      using MATLAB's <b>imshow()</b> command, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function, instead, allows a user to display a numeric array by passing
      it directly as the argument to a function called <b>imshow_numeric()</b>, which
      makes a quick and simple conversion of the numeric data to
      a format of the appropriate type and range for display.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current version of the program only handles grayscale data, that is,
      a 2D numeric array.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>imshow_numeric</b> ( <i>A</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>A</b> is an <b>M</b> by <b>N</b> numeric array.
