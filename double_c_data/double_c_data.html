    <p>
      <b>DOUBLE_C_DATA</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      can create, plot, or save a "double C" dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data is confined to two separate regions, each having the shape of
      the letter "C".  The two regions are close, and interlocking, but do not
      actually touch.  This data represents a difficult challenge for algorithms
      that attempt to detect natural segmentations of data.
