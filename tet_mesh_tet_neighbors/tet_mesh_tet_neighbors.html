      TET_MESH_TET_NEIGHBORS <br>
      Interactive Program for <br>
      Tet Mesh Neighbors
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TET_MESH_TET_NEIGHBORS</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads information defining
      a tet mesh of points in 3D, and determines, for each face of
      each tetrahedron, the index of the neighboring tetrahedron that
      shares that face.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tet mesh is defined by a <i>node file</i> containing
      the coordinates of nodes, and a <i>tetra file</i> containing
      sets of 4 or 10 node indices.  For this calculation, though,
      only the tetra file is needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a tetrahedron is on the boundary, then one or more of its
      faces will not be shared by any tetrahedron.  Such cases will
      be indicated by specifying the corresponding neighbor value as -1.

        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>_elements.txt</b>,    the element definitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>_elements.neighbors.txt</b>,    the element neighbors.
