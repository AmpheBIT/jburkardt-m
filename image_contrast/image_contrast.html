      IMAGE_CONTRAST <br> Enhance Contrast in an Image
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_CONTRAST</b>
      is a MATLAB function which
      carries out a simple contrast enhancement operation on an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that MATLAB's image processing toolbox includes a functions such
      as <b>nlfilter</b> which can do a more sophisticated treatment of images.
      But the purpose of this example is to demonstrate the process of image
      enhancement in a way that is clear enough to understand quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a gray-scale image, the function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function <i>gray_enhanced</i> = <b>contrast_gray</b> ( <i>gray</i>, <i>s</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>gray</i> is an <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> <b>uint8</b>
          (short integers, 0 to 255) array containing the gray scale values;
          MATLAB's <b>imread()</b> command can be used to create such a
          dataset from a graphics image file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>s</i> is the sharpness parameter.  Normally, <b>s</b> is
          greater than 1, and larger values increase the contrast.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>gray_enhanced</i> is an <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> <b>uint8</b>
          (short integer) array containing the gray scale values
          after the contrast has been enhanced.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding function <b>contrast_rgb()</b> operates on RGB images.
