      LINEAR_SOLVE_DISTRIBUTED <br> Solution of a Distributed Linear System
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LINEAR_SOLVE_DISTRIBUTED</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      solves a linear system <b>A*x=b</b> using MATLAB's <b>spmd</b> facility,
      so that the matrix <b>A</b> is "distributed" across multiple MATLAB workers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example only illustrates the use of <b>spmd</b>, but does not
      really explain much about what's going on.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use a number of MATLAB workers, LAB_NUM.
    </p>

    <p>
      We declare a matrix <b>A</b> of size <b>N</b> by <b>N</b>, but we use the
      <b>codistributor()</b> function, so that <b>A</b> is distributed among the
      workers, which each get an <b>N</b> by <b>(N/LAB_NUM)</b> portion of the matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a given right hand side <b>b</b>, MATLAB's backslash function is able
      to solve the linear system <b>A*x=b</b>, even though the matrix is distributed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result, <b>x</b> is compared to the exact solution (a vector of 1's)
      and the norm of the error is returned.
    </p>
