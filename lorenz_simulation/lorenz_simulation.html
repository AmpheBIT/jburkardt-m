      LORENZ_SIMULATION <br> Display a solution of the Lorenz Equations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LORENZ_SIMULATION</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      computes and displays solutions to the Lorenz equations
      for various initial conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz equations are an extremely simplified model of the weather,
      in which three differential equations describe the evolution of three
      variables.  There are also three parameters whose values play the role
      of physical constants.  
    </p>

    <p>
      It was while studying these equations that Edward Lorenz discovered
      what he called "deterministic chaos".  That is, at least for certain
      values of the parameters, solutions were extremely sensitive to the
      initial conditions.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz equations are often written as
      <pre>
        x' = sigma * ( y - x )
        y' = x * ( rho - z ) - y
        z' = x * y - beta * z
      </pre>
      where the parameters are positive.  Typical values for the parameters are
      <pre>
        sigma = 10
        beta = 8 / 3 = 2.666...
        rho = 28
      </pre>
      The value of rho has a strong influence on the behavior of solutions.
      The value rho=28 results in chaotic solutions, whereas rho=99.96 yields
      a regular pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>LORENZ_SIMULATION</b> program shows a 3D plot of the behavior of a solution
      to the Lorenz equations.  The initial condition is varied randomly
      each time the user runs the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is actually already a Lorenz demonstration program, called 
      <b>lorenzdemo</b>, which is part of the MATLAB demo set.
    </p>

    <p>
      We modified the original program because we wanted to be able to
      vary the initial condition for the integration.  This turned out to
      be far more difficult than we realized, since the <b>lorenzdemo</b>
      program is full of code that looks important, but actually is not used.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The key is that the <b>lorenzdemo</b> displays some buttons, and as soon
      as you push a button, it calls "lorenz", which is a built in MATLAB
      function.  This function is probably the same as <b>lorenzdemo</b>.  
      However, if you change <b>lorenzdemo</b>, you have not changed "lorenz"!
      In other words, you can make all the changes you want to <b>lorenzdemo</b>,
      but most of them will have no effect whatsoever, since <b>lorenzdemo</b>
      actually calls "lorenz".
    </p>

    <p>
      It is inadvertently cryptic coding like this that fills the wards 
      of our hospitals with bitter, disillusioned people who have lost all 
      faith in their ability to understand programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version, with the slightly altered name "lorenz_simulation", calls itself.
      Thus, if you change this code, you will see a change when you run it.
      For our purposes, we were able to change the initial condition Y0, and
      have that effect the calculation as we wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note, also, that the ordering of the variables is somewhat different
      than is to be seen in other contexts.  For <b>LORENZ_SIMULATION</b>, the
      equations are
      <pre>
        x' = y * z - beta * x
        y' = sigma * ( z - y )
        z' = y * ( rho - x ) - z
      </pre>
    </p>
