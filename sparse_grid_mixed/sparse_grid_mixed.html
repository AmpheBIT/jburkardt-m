    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_MIXED</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      can be used to construct a sparse grid whose factors are
      possibly distinct 1D quadrature rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 1D quadrature rules are designed to approximate an integral
      of the form:
      <blockquote><b>
        Integral ( A < X < B ) F(X) W(X) dX
      </b></blockquote>
      where <b>W(X)</b> is a weight function, by the quadrature sum:
      <blockquote><b>
        Sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER) F(X(I)) * W(I)
      </b></blockquote>
      where the set of <b>X</b> values are known as <i>abscissas</i> and
      the set of <b>W</b> values are known as <i>weights</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the letter <b>W</b>, unfortunately, is used to denote both the
      weight function in the original integral, and the vector of weight
      values in the quadrature sum.

    <p>
      A sparse grid is a quadrature rule for a multidimensional integral.
      It is formed by taking a certain linear combination of lower-order
      product rules.  The product rules, in turn, are formed as direct products
      of 1D quadrature rules.  It is common to form a sparse grid in which the
      1D component quadrature rules are the same.  This package, however,
      is intended to produce sparse grids based on sums of product rules for
      which the rule chosen for each spatial dimension may be freely chosen
      from the set listed above.
    </p>

    <p>
      These sparse grids are still indexed by a number known as <b>level</b>,
      and assembled as a sum of low order product rules.  As the value of
      <b>level</b> increases, the point growth becomes more complicated.
      This is because the 1D rules have somewhat varying point growth patterns
      to begin with, and the varying levels of nestedness have a dramatic
      effect on the sparsity of the total grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since a sparse grid is made up of a combination of product grids,
      it is frequently the case that many of the product grids include the
      same point.  For efficiency, it is usually desirable to merge or
      consolidate such duplicate points when expressing the resulting
      sparse grid rule.  It is possible to "logically" determine when
      a duplicate point will be generated; however, this logic changes
      depending on the specific 1-dimensional rules being used, and the
      tests can become quite elaborate.  Moreover, for rules which include
      real parameters, the determination of duplication can require
      a numerical tolerance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to simplify the matter of the detection of duplicate points,
      the codes presented begin by generating the entire "naive" set of
      points.  Then a user-specified tolerance <b>TOL</b> is used to determine when
      two points are equal.  If the maximum difference between any two components
      is less than or equal to <b>TOL</b>, the points are declared to be equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      A reasonable value for <b>TOL</b> might be the square root of the machine
      precision.  Setting <b>TOL</b> to zero means that only points which are
      identical to the last significant digit are taken to be duplicates.  Setting
      <b>TOL</b> to a negative value means that no duplicate points will be eliminated -
      in other words, this choice produces the full or "naive" grid.
