      TABLE_MERGE <br> Merge Duplicate or Nearby Points.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_MERGE</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      can be used to remove duplicate points from a file, or 
      to merge points that are very close.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, each point is in its own cluster.  If two clusters
      are separated by a distance of less than the tolerance, then
      they are replaced by one cluster, whose representative point
      is the weighted sum of the two cluster representatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The clusters are repeatedly processed until all clusters are
      separated by a distance of at least the tolerance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This algorithm may be useful when a dataset containing a number
      of points is given, and
      <ul>
        <li>
          duplicate points must be removed (in this case, a value of
          TOLERANCE = 0 will work)
        </li>
        <li>
          OR, points that are very close to each other should be discarded.
          In this case, a "small" value of TOLERANCE is appropriate.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this procedure depends on the ordering of the points.
      If you have three points A < B < C separated by slightly
      less than the tolerance, then A and B will be merged or B and C
      will be merged, depending on the labels of the nodes.  Thus
      this process is not a strictly geometric procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, it should be obvious that the procedure may return
      points that were not input points, because of the use of centroids.
    </p>

    <p>
      Third, this procedure does guarantee that the output points are
      separated by more than TOLERANCE units of distance.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>table_merge</b> ( <i>'table_file'</i>, <i>tolerance</i> )
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the points in <i>table_file</i>, removes duplicates,
          replaces points that are within <i>tolerance</i> of each
          other by a centroid, and writes out the revised file.
        </dd>
      </dl>
