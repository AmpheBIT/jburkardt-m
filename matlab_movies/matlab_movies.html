      MATLAB MOVIES <br>
      Animating Data in MATLAB
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_MOVIES</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate the making of animations.
      If you have used MATLAB to make graphics images before, then
      you will be glad to know that it isn't too hard to make an animation,
      by stringing a series of related pictures together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, you need to have a series of images that do make
      a sensible sequence, you need to make sure that the individual
      images use the same picture size, plot scale, color bars and so on.
      Of things to worry about include figuring out what kind of movie
      file you want to create.  But let's get on to the fun part!

      Marcus Garvie has provided examples, based on a Linux version
      of MATLAB.  To
