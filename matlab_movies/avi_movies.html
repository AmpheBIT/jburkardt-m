      Creating AVI Movies from MATLAB images <br>

    <p>
      Here are a couple of examples of how to use MATLAB to make Audio 
      Video Interleaved (AVI) movies on Linux.  The resulting movies
      can be played independently of MATLAB.  On Linux, for instance, 
      there is the free XINE AVI movie player, and on a PC, there are
      Windows Media Player or QuickTime. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are happy just playing a movie within MATLAB then see 
      <blockquote><i>

      </i></blockquote>
      in the MATLAB help pages.  Note that a number of web-sites
      recommend using the free 'mpgwrite' software to convert a Matlab movie
      to an MPEG movie, but this doesn't appear to work with Linux anymore 
      (the system crashes).
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of the animation of a simple series of sine wave
      graphs, each created with the <b>plot</b> command.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "make_avi_movie_example1.m">the source code;</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "show_sinwave_avi.html">display the AVI movie</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "show_sinwave_mpg.html">show the MPG version</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the second example, the graphic image is "2D", a color contour
      plot of a 2D sine wave.  The AVI movie takes much longer to create,
      and contains 51 frames:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "make_avi_movie_example2.m">
          the source code</a> or
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "show_2dsinwave_avi.html">display the AVI movie</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "show_2dsinwave_mpg.html">show the MPG version</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Both these examples should be easily adapted to make other movies.
      For some reason in the 2D case replacing the plotting command 'pcolor'
      with 'surf' doesn't work very well. There's probably a simple remedy.
      Another problem is that AVI movie files can be very large. A solution
      to this problem is to compress the AVI files, which requires additional
      software (ask Computer Support).
    </p>

      Some brief notes regarding the use of the Linux movie player XINE are
      given here. After XINE has been installed on your machine (ask 
      Computer Support) follow these steps after creating your AVI movie
      in Matlab:
      <ol>
        <li>
          in a terminal window, type 'xine' (Enter);
        </li>
        <li>
          Right click mouse, then select open - file;
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose directory - filename, and the appropriate filter to 
          show only AVI files;
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on the desired AVI file;
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on <b>Select</b>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once a file has been selected, it can be played quickly via
      <blockquote>
	Right click mouse - Playback - Play
      </blockquote>
      See the menu list for additional options (e.g. to control the speed 
      at which the movie is played).
