HEX_GRID_DATASET (MATLAB version)
  Generate a hexagonal grid dataset.

  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * X1, Y1, the lower left corner of the region,
  * X2, Y2, the upper right corner of the region,
  * NODES_PER_LAYER, the number of nodes per layer,

  The program generates the data, writes it to the file

    hex_grid_NPL_L_N.txt

  "NPL" is the number of nodes per layer,
  "L" is the number of layers,
  "N" is the number of nodes,

  After the dataset of nodes is computed, it is
  written to a file, and another dataset may be made.


  ( X1, Y1 ) is the lower left corner of the region:.
  (Try '[0, 0]' if you have no preference.)
  Enter X1, Y1:  [1,2]
  User input X1, Y1 = ( 1.000000, 2.000000 ).

  ( X2, Y2 ) is the upper right corner of the region:.
  (Try '[10, 10]' if you have no preference.)
  (Just press RETURN if you want to quit.)
  Enter X2, Y2:  [4,7]
  User input X2, Y2 = ( 4.000000, 7.000000 ).

  NODES_PER_LAYER is the number of nodes per layer.
  (Try '10' if you have no preference.)
  (Any value less than 1 terminates execution.
  (Or just press RETURN if you want to quit.)
  Enter NODES_PER_LAYER:  10
  User input NODES_PER_LAYER = 10

  The number of layers will be 18.
  The X spacing will be 3.333333e-001.
  The Y spacing will be 2.886751e-001.
  The number of nodes will be 171.

  The data was written to the file "hex_grid_10_18_171.txt".

  Enter "Y" if you want to define another dataset:n

HEX_GRID_DATASET:
  Normal end of execution.
