      BIRTHDAY_REMOTE <br>
      Remote Execution of a Parallel MATLAB Program
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BIRTHDAY_REMOTE</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how to submit a parallel MATLAB program to run on a remote
      machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before remote submission of jobs is possible, you must have an account on
      the remote machine, and go through some steps to ensure that that machine
      and your desktop machine can communicate properly.  If you have not
      carried out these steps, refer to the document
      <i>"Notes on Enabling Remote Submission of MATLAB Jobs"</i> listed
      in the references below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The underlying program, birthday.m, simply assigns birthdays to each
      member in a group, then checks if any pair has a common birthday.
    </p>

    <p>
      The intermediate program birthdayscript.m calls birthday.m many times, carrying out
      a Monte Carlo investigation to estimate the probability of this event
      for a variety of group sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The higher level program brunbirthday.m uses MATLAB's BATCH command to
      submit a job that carries out birthdayscript either on your local desktop,
      or else on a remote system - in particular, Virginia Tech's ITHACA cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example illustrates the use of the BATCH command.  "brunbirthday"
      is implemented as a function rather than a script, so that we can wait
      for the job to complete before retrieving the result and setting the
      return value of <i>prob</i>.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Start up MATLAB on your desktop.  Under the Parallel Menu, make sure you
      have selected either the "local" configuration, or the configuration that
      corresponds to a remote machine on which you wish to run the job.
      Then, at the MATLAB prompt, type
      <blockquote>
        <i>prob</i> = brunbirthday ( <i>nw</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>nw</i> is the number of workers that you wish to be employed
          in the parallel execution of the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prob</i> is the computed probability.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The BATCH command is arguably more useful in cases where the user wants
      the batch job to "run in the background" - so that the user can continue
      interacting with MATLAB while that particular calculation is going on.
      If you want to experiment with this way of working, then instead of
      issued the "brunbirthday" command, you can issue the following command
      (which is actually part of brunbirthday!):
      <blockquote>
        <i>my_job</i> = batch('birthdayscript','FileDependencies','birthday.m', ...
                                                          'matlabpool', <i>nw</i>);
      </blockquote>
      from the MATLAB comand window, assuming that you have set <i>nw</i> to
      the desired number of workers.  The job will be worked on in the background.
      In order for you to check to see if it is finished, issue the command
      <blockquote>
        <i>state</i> = get ( <i>my_job</i>, 'state' )
      </blockquote>
      The value of <i>state</i> will tell you the job's status.
