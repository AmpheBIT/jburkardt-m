      TRIANGULATION_ORIENT <br> Positively Orient Triangles
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_ORIENT</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      reads a triangulation, and reorients each triangle that
      has a negative area.  If at least one such triangle is encountered,
      the program writes out a new copy of the triangle file in which
      all the triangles have been correctly oriented.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node information
      for the triangulation.  Each data line contains the X and 
      Y coordinates of a single node.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt contains the triangle information
      for the triangulation.  Each line contains the indices of 3 or 6
      nodes that form a triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      For many applications, including computer graphics and finite
      element computations, it is assumed that the triangles are
      described with a positive orientation.  That is, the nodes
      are listed in clockwise order.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_ORIENT</b> can check whether every triangle
      in a triangulation has positive orientation, and can "repair"
      the file if it finds one or more triangles with a negative orientation.
