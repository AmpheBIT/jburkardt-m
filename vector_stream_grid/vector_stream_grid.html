      Uniform Grid from Scattered Data

    <p>
      <b>VECTOR_STREAM_GRID</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      reads vector data defined at possibly scattered points to produce
      a graph of the vector field's streamlines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is mainly a preprocessor for MATLAB's <b>streamline</b>
      routine.  It reads the (X,Y) coordinates of a set of points from 
      a "node" file, and the corresponding vector values
      from a "vector" file.  It uses MATLAB's <b>griddata</b> facility
      to create an interpolatory function to the given data.
      The interpolated function is then sampled on a regular grid,
      and the data is used to produce the plot plot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both the node and vector files are simple "table" files whose
      format is described online.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program was written as a quick and convenient way to
      view finite element data.  It can also be used for any situation
      in which a collection of points and vectors are available.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, a small "sin" is committed when we use this program
      on finite element data, since we take only the node locations 
      and vector values, but not the elements.  We simply use MATLAB's grid 
      data feature which constructs a cubic spline interpolant to 
      scattered data.  This is OK, and probably doesn't distort the 
      data too much, but in fact, we are not actually viewing 
      values of the finite element function, and there is no guarantee
      that this surrogate function will actually satisfy the boundary
      conditions or other characteristics of the finite element
      function.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>VECTOR_STREAM_GRID</b> is based in part on a plotting routine
      written by Professor Hyung-Chun Lee of Ajou University, Korea.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>vector_stream_grid</b> ( <i>node_file</i>, <i>vector_file</i>, <i>grid_num</i>, <i>sample_num</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>node_file</i> is the name of the node file, which must be a quoted string;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>vector_file</i> is the name of the vector file, which must be a quoted string;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>grid_num</i> is the number of grid points to use in one direction.  This is
          actually the number that will be used in the <i>longest</i>
          dimension of the region.  A value of 10 or 20 is reasonable to start
          with, which would result in 100 or 400 grid points if your 
          region happens
          to be a square.   The grid points don't show up directly in
          your plot, but you should use enough so that the function
          can be smoothly defined.       
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>sample_num</i> is the number of sample points to use in one direction.  This is
          actually the number that will be used in the <i>longest</i>
          dimension of the region.  A value of 5 or 10 might be reasonable,
          resulting in 25 or 100 streamlines, for instance.
        </li>
      </ul>
