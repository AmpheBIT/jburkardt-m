    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRAFFIC_SIMULATION</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      simulates the way cars must wait at a traffic light.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user can only input the number of 10-second time periods to
      be simulated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program operates with the following internal parameters:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>GREEN</b>, the number of 10-second time periods that 
          a green light lasts, set to 2.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P</b>, the probability that a new car will come to the light
          in the next second, set to 0.3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PERIOD_LENGTH</b>, the number of seconds in one time period,
          set to 10.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RED</b>, the number of 10-second time periods that 
          a red light lasts, set to 4.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>traffic_simulation</b> ( <i>n</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>n</i> is the number of 10-second time cycles.
        </li>
