      NESTED_SEQUENCE_DISPLAY <br> Display a Nested Set of Sequences
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NESTED_SEQUENCE_DISPLAY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      displays a set of sequences, as lines of X values, "stacked up"
      in the Y direction.  For cases where sequences share
      a value, a red vertical line is drawn to highlight this.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of the plot is to emphasize the structure of a 
      nested sequence, although it is not actually necessary for the 
      sequences to be related in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The kind of plot we are thinking of though, might look something 
      like this:
      <pre>
    Sequence 4: 1    3 4  5  6     8
                |    |    |        |
    Sequence 3: 1 2  |    5     7  |
                |    |          |  |
    Sequence 2: 1    3          7  |
                |               |  |
    Sequence 1: 1               7  8
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the program could be used to show the nesting of
      the family of Clenshaw Curtis points, when choosing orders
      1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33, 65, ...

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>nested_sequence_display</b> ()
      </blockquote>
      invokes the program.  It then
      engages in a dialog with the user, who is asked to enter, one
      by one, the names of files containing the sequences.  When there
      are no more files to enter, the user should enter 'RETURN'.
      At that point, the plot will be drawn.
