          grid and the Gauss-Patterson grid in d = 2 or d = 3 dimensions,
          level N. If N is omitted, N is taken to 4. If D is omitted, D

          plot a graph showing the

          computing interpolated values ONLY (at 100 points simultaneously). 
          By default, the Clenshaw-Curtis-grid with sparse indices data is 
          used. Alternatively, the Chebyshev grid and other options
          may be selected using an OPTIONS structure created with SPSET.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "timespinterp.m">timespinterp.m</a>
          draw a graph showing
          the time to compute 1000 interpolated points with SPINTERP. By
          default, the Clenshaw-Curtis-grid is used. Other grid types
          can be selected using the SPSET method. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "../html/timespinterp.png">timespinterp.png</a>

          test the performance of the
          sparse grid interpolation routine SPVALS by measuring the
          required time to compute the hierarchical surpluses. By default,
          the Clenshaw-Curtis grid is used. Other grid types can be
          selected using the SPSET method. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "../html/timespvals.png">timespvals.png</a>

        <li>
          <a href = "timespvalsdct.m">timespvalsdct.m</a>
          compares the performance of SPVALS for the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto grid
