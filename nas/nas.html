      NAS <br> A Revision of the NASA Kernel Benchmark Program
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NAS</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      is a revision of David Bailey's NASA kernel benchmark program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>NAS</b> benchmark program was developed around 1984, and
      measured computational performance on a representative range
      of realistic calculations.  One motivation for this benchmark was
      to move beyond the LINPACK benchmark, which focussed on a single
      highly structured procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Benchmarking computers has become much more difficult now that
      memory, I/O, multicores and distributed memory have all become
      significant factors in computing performance.  Nonetheless, the
      NAS benchmarks provide an interesting insight into the floating
      point processing power of a system, and so, for this reason, a
      version of the program has been created that retains the functionality
      of the original, while being somewhat easier to transfer to
      other languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version of the benchmark runs remarkably poorly under MATLAB.
      The performance could be greatly improved if effort was made to
      vectorize some of the code.  For example, the matrix multiplication
      benchmark, which has been vectorized, runs very well.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>nas</b>
      </blockquote>
      runs the program, and prints the error, timing, and MegaFLOPS results.
