      FEM_50 <br> A Finite Element Program <br> in 50 Lines of MATLAB
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM_50</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      applies the finite
      element method to solving Laplace's equation in an arbitrary
      region, using about 50 lines of MATLAB code,
      by Jochen Alberty, Carsten Carstensen, Stefan Funken.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>FEM_50</b> is partly a demonstration, to show how little it
      takes to implement the finite element method (at least using
      every possible MATLAB shortcut.)  The user supplies datafiles
      that specify the geometry of the region and its arrangement
      into triangular and quadrilateral elements, and the location
      and type of the boundary conditions, which can be any mixture
      of Neumann and Dirichlet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unknown state variable <b>U(x,y)</b> is assumed to satisfy
      Laplace's equation:
      <blockquote><b>
        -Uxx(x,y) - Uyy(x,y) = F(x,y) in Omega
      </b></blockquote>
      with Dirichlet boundary conditions
      <blockquote><b>
        U(x,y) = U_D(x,y) on Gamma<sub>D</sub>
      </b></blockquote>
      and Neumann boundary conditions on the outward normal derivative:
      <blockquote><b>
        Un(x,y) = G(x,y) on Gamma<sub>N</sub>
      </b></blockquote>
      If <b>Gamma</b> designates the boundary of the region <b>Omega</b>,
      then we presume that
      <blockquote><b>
        Gamma = Gamma<sub>D</sub> + Gamma<sub>N</sub>
      </b></blockquote>
      but the user is free to determine which boundary conditions to
      apply.  Note, however, that the problem will generally be singular
      unless at least one Dirichlet boundary condition is specified.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code uses piecewise linear basis functions for triangular elements,
      and piecewise isoparametric bilinear basis functions for quadrilateral
      elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user is required to supply a number of data files and MATLAB
      functions that specify the location of nodes, the grouping of nodes
      into elements, the location and value of boundary conditions, and 
      the right hand side function in Laplace's equation.  Note that the
      fact that the geometry is completely up to the user means that
      just about any two dimensional region can be handled, with arbitrary
      shape, including holes and islands.
