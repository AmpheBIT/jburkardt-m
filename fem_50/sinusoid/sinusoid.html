      SINUSOID - A problem with sinusoidal solution
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      The <b>SINUSOID</b> problem has as exact solution
      U(X,Y)=SIN(PI*X)*SIN(PI*Y).  It uses a 13 by 13 grid
      on [0,1] x [0,1]; zero Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied.
      Only triangular elements are used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though we don't use quadrilateral elements and Neumann
      boundary conditions, we include dummy files for that data,
      because the code will look for them.

      Files you may copy include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "coordinates.dat">coordinates.dat</a>,
          the spatial coordinates of the nodes.

          <a href = "dirichlet.dat">dirichlet.dat</a>,
          the edges of the region along which Dirichlet boundary conditions
          are specified.  Edges are denoted by pairs of nodes, and the
          nodes should be listed in their counterclockwise order around
          the region.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "elements3.dat">elements3.dat</a>,
          defines the triangular elements by listing the indices of their
          vertices.  The vertices should be listed in counterclockwise order.

          <a href = "elements4.dat">elements4.dat</a>,
