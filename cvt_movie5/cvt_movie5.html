      CVT_MOVIE5 <br> Animated CVT Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_MOVIE5</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      animates the generation of a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      This particular computation occurs in the same region of interesting
      shape that was used for
      <a href = "../cvt_movie3/cvt_movie3.html">CVT_MOVIE3</a>.  However, in
      this case, there are three important differences:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the points were initialized by a hexagonal grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          a few points at corners were fixed in position.
        </li>
        <li>
          the CVT sampling procedure used a "fat" region; but when
          centroids were lured out of the true region, they were projected
          back to the boundary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of the calculation was to modify the CVT iteration so
      that generators would be produced on the boundary of the region,
      and in a fairly natural way.  The calculation was done by
      <a href = "../../f_src/cvt_movie5_data/cvt_movie5_data.html">
      CVT_MOVIE5_DATA</a>, and the results stored in 101 text files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>CVT_MOVIE5</b> program illustrates the result of the
      calculation by reading in the data files, drawing the Voronoi
      diagram and the region boundary, and creating a series of 
      <a href = "../../data/jpg/jpg.html">JPG files</a>, each
      containing one frame of the animation.  It is possible to
      create an animation by using software such as Apple QuickTime.
