      Here is an MPEG-4 movie, created by the CVT_MOVIE5 program, showing the
      evolution of the points in a CVT iteration.  In this case, the points
      were initialized from a hexagonal grid.  Several points were fixed
      (at the corners).  And sampling was done on a "fat" region, which
      pulled some centroids out of the standard region.  These centroids
      were projected back to the boundary.  (Our goal was to get a set of
      points that included points on the boundary in a natural way.)

    <p>
      The command which created this movie was
      <blockquote><b>
        cvt_movie5
      </b></blockquote>
      The data had actually been computed earlier, so it simply had to
      be read in, the Voronoi regions computed, and the boundary of the
      region displayed.

      If your browser won't display the movie, perhaps you can 
      <a href = "cvt_movie5.mp4">download cvt_movie5.mp4</a>
      to your machine and THEN display it.
