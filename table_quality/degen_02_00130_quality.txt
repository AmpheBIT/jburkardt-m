TABLE_QUALITY:
  (MATLAB version):
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.

  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.

TABLE_QUALITY:
  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "degen_02_00130.txt"

  The sampling routine is "SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM".

  The number of sample points NS =       100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =       123456789

  The minimum angle measure    Alpha =       0.000000
  The regularity measure         Chi =       7.944060
  2nd moment determinant measure   D =  4.358317e-008

  The mesh ratio               Gamma =       6.555216
  The point distribution norm      H =       0.070549
  The COV measure             Lambda =       0.156217
  The point distribution ratio    Mu =       1.447183
