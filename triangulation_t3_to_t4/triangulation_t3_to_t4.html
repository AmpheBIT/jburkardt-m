    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_T3_TO_T4</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      reads information 
      describing a triangulation of a set of points using 3-node
      "T3" triangles, and creates a 4-node "T4"
      triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same number of triangles are used, but each triangle
      is given one extra node at the centroid.  The coordinates of 
      these nodes are determined by averaging the coordinates of
      the vertices of the triangles.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input and output files use the simple 
      <a href = "../../data/table/table.html">TABLE format</a>;
      comment lines begin with a "#" character.  Otherwise, each line
      of the file contains one set of information, either the coordinates
      of a node (for a node file), or the indices of nodes that make up
      a triangle, (for a triangle file).
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node information
      for the 3-node triangulation.  Each data line contains the X and 
      Y coordinates of a single node.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt contains the triangle information
      for the 3-node triangulation.  Each line contains the indices of three 
      nodes that form a triangle, in counterclockwise order.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The output file <i>prefix</i>_t4_nodes.txt contains the node information
      for the 4-node triangulation.  It begins with the node information
      from <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt, followed by the coordinates of the new nodes.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The output file <i>prefix</i>_t4_triangles.txt contains the triangle 
      information for the 4-node triangulation.  There are exactly
      as many triangles as before, but now each triangle uses four nodes.
      Each line of the file contains the indices of 4 nodes that form the
      triangle.  The first three indices are the vertices, in counterclockwise 
      order.  The fourth index is the centroid node..
