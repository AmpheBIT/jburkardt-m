      PRIME_SPMD <br> Counting Primes in Parallel using SPMD
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PRIME_SPMD</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      counts the number of primes between 1 and N,
      executing in parallel using MATLAB's SPMD facility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm is completely naive.  For each integer I, it simply checks
      whether any smaller J evenly divides it.  The total amount of work
      for a given N is thus roughly proportional to 1/2*N^2.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is very little memory traffic and no communication, so this program
      is a good test for the pure computational speedup offered by MATLAB's
      Parallel Programming Toolbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The basic function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function total = prime_fun ( n )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          n, the largest integer to check.
        </li>
        <li>
          total, the number of primes between 1 and n.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the Ithaca cluster, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
