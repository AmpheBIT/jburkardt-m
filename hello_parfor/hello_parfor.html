      HELLO_PARFOR <br>
      A Parallel MATLAB Function Using PARFOR
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HELLO_PARFOR</b>
      is a directory which
      illustrates how a MATLAB function using the PARFOR statement
      can be run in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, the underlying MATLAB program is a simple function
      that says "Hello, world!" a certain number of times.
      The loop used to print these statements is controlled by a
      <b>parfor</b> command.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function has the form:
      <blockquote>
        function hello_fun ( n )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          n, is the number of times to print "Hello, world!".
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the situation, the function could be executed in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>
          interactively, and locally, using the <b>matlabpool</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and locally, using the <b>batch</b> command;
        </li>
        <li>
          indirectly, and on the FSU HPC cluster, using the <b>fsuClusterMatlab</b> command;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
