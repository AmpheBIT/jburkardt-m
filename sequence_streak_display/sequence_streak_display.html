      SEQUENCE_STREAK_DISPLAY <br> Display a "Streak Plot" of a Sequence
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SEQUENCE_STREAK_DISPLAY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      displays a "streak plot" of a numeric sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is very simple.  We can think of a sequence Y as the
      pairs of values (I,Y(I)).  We can then plot this sequence in the
      usual way.  To make a "streak plot", however, we now extend a
      horizontal ray from each plotted point all the way to the right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such a plot can be useful for examing the van der Corput sequence,
      for instance, which "fills in" the unit interval in a regular way.
      Looking at the streak plot, you can see the gaps between values
      shrinking as you move to the right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another possible use for such plots is for sequences with one,
      or better yet several, accumulation points.  In that case, you
      will see the streak lines clustering together as you proceed.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>sequence_streak_display</b> ( <i>'filename'</i>, <i>'direction'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>'filename'</b> is a quoted string or string variable containing
          the name of the file with the data;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>'direction'</b> is a quoted character or character variable
          with the value 'R', 'L', 'U' or 'D' depending on whether
          the sequence is to be shown horizontally ('R' or 'L') or vertically
          ('U' or 'D'), with the streak starting ('R' or 'U') or ending
          ('L' or 'D') at the sequence value.
        </li>
      </ul>
