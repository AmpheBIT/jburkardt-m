      FIBONACCI_SPIRAL <br> The Fibonacci Spiral
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FIBONACCI_SPIRAL</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      displays points on a Fibonacci spiral, suggesting the arrangement of seeds
      in a sunflower, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirals exhibited in nature can be modeled by a simple spiral of points
      generated, in polar coordinates, by starting at R = 0, A = 0, and then
      repeated incrementing R by dR = 1, and A by an angle dA of about 137.5 degrees,
      or, more precisely, by 2 * PI * ( PHI - 1 ) / PHI radians, where PHI is
      the Golden Ratio, equal to (1+sqrt(5))/2.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spiral along which the points occur sequentially is not, in fact,
      what the viewer first notices.  Instead, an image of the spiral will seem
      to exhibit two families of spirals emerging at a sharp angle from the center.
      One family rotates clockwise, the other counter-clockwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <b>fibonacci_spiral</b> simply displays the blue dots representing
      the points; in this image, the Fibonacci spirals are evident.  The program
      <b>fibonacci_spiral_connected</b> includes a red spiral line that connects the
      dots in the sequence in which they are generated.  Plots of this kind are 
      not very legible after 100 or so points.
