      FILE_INCREMENT <br> Increment an Integer Array Stored in a File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FILE_INCREMENT</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      increments every entry of an integer array which is stored in a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is restricted to handling a file that can be recognized as having
      M lines of text, each line containing N integer values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program might be most naturally useful if a given file contains an array
      of index values that need to be converted between 0-based and 1-based indexing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the following MATLAB commands will work faster:
      <pre>
        array = load ( 'input_file' );
        array = array + increment;
        save -ASCII 'output_file' array;
      </pre>
      However, the data is written in real number format, with exponents.
      I specifically want the output to be integers in recognizably integer formats.
      I don't care if it takes longer and requires more MATLAB commands.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>file_increment</b> ( <i>'input_file'</i>, <i>'output_file'</i>, <i>increment</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'input_file'</i>, the name of the file containing the data to be incremented.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'output_file'</i>, the name of the file to contain the incremented data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>increment</i>, the amount by which all the data should be incremented.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      <b>RBC</b> is a set of 500 3D nodes and 996 triangles.  The triangle data was
      given using 1-based indexing, but the plotting program to be used expected
      0-based indexing.  Therefore, the file
      RBC_ELEMENTS_0.TXT was created by the command:
      <pre>
        file_increment ( 'rbc_elements_1.txt', 'rbc_elements_0.txt', -1 )
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "rbc_nodes.txt">rbc_nodes.txt</a>
          500 node coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "rbc_elements_0.txt">rbc_elements_0.txt</a>
          996 triangles, defined using 0-based indexing of the nodes.
