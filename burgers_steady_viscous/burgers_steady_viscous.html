      BURGERS_STEADY_VISCOUS <br> 
      Steady Viscous Burgers Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BURGERS_STEADY_VISCOUS</b> is a MATLAB library which
      solves the steady (time-independent) viscous Burgers equation
      using a finite difference discretization of the conservative form 
      of the equation, and then applying Newton's method to solve the
      resulting nonlinear system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function u(x) is to be solved for in the equation:
      <blockquote>
        u * du/dx = nu * d^2u/dx^2
      </blockquote>
      for 0 &lt; nu, a &lt;= x &lt;= b.
    </p>

    <p>
      Problem data includes the endpoints a and b, the Dirichlet boundary values
      u(a) = alpha, u(b) = beta, and the value of the viscosity nu.  
    </p>

    <p>
      We can discretize the problem by specifying a sequence of n (perhaps equally
      spaced) points x, and applying standard finite difference approximations
      to the derivatives in the continuous equation.  A piecewise linear discretization 
      of the solution can then be computed by bsv().
    </p>

    <p>
      When alpha and beta have opposite sign, the solution must cross the
      x-axis (at least once).  The location x0 of this crossing is of interest,
      and can be computed by bsv_crossing().
    </p>

    <p>
      The crossing location may be quite susceptible to the values of alpha and beta.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conservative form of the equation is
      <blockquote>
        1/2 * d(u^2)/dx = nu * d^2u/dx^2
      </blockquote>
      and this is the version we discretize.  The residual associated with node i
      is then
      <blockquote>
        f(i) = 1/2 * ( u(i+1)^2 - u(i-1)^2 / ( 2 * dx )
        - nu * ( u(i-1) - 2 * u(i) + u(i+1) ) / dx^2
      </blockquote>
      and we can apply Newton's method to seek a solution u for which f is zero.
