      TABLE_READ <br> Read an ASCII matrix data file.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_READ</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      can read an ASCII
      file defining a matrix of data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file may contain comment lines, which begin with a '#'
      in column 1.  Otherwise, each line of the file contains all the
      entries of the next row of the matrix.  Thus, in particular,
      every non-comment line must have exactly the same number of values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of the kind of file that <b>TABLE_READ</b>
      expects to process:

    #  Number of points N =  10
    #
    #  Initial SEED =    123456789
    #  Initialization by UNIFORM.
    #  Sampling by UNIFORM.

      <b>TABLE_READ</b> automatically skips over the comments,
      and "realizes" that the array is dimensioned 10 by 2.
