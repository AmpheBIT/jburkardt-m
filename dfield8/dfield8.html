    <p>
      <b>DFIELD8</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      interactively displays the direction field of a differential equation,
      by John Polking.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>DFIELD8</b> is an interactive tool for studying single first order
      differential equations.  When the program is executed, a setup
      window is opened.  The user may enter the differential
      equation and specify a display window using the interactive
      controls in the Setup window.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Proceed button is pressed on the Setup window, the 
      Display window is opened.  At first this window displays a
      direction line field for the differential equation.  When the
      mouse button is depressed in the Display window, the
      solution to the differential equation with that initial
      condition is calculated and plotted.
