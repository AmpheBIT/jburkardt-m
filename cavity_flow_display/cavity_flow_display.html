    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CAVITY_FLOW_DISPLAY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      displays the velocity field at a single timestep, presumably from a series
      of solutions of a time-dependent incompressible flow in a 
      2D driven cavity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "CAVITY" region is the unit square, [0,1]x[0,1], open on the top, 
      along which a tangential flow is specified, with walls along the
      sides and bottom.

      An evenly spaced grid of 41x41 = 1,681 nodes, is used.
      These nodes are organized into 800 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure.
