      GRIDLINES <br> Add Grid Lines to a MATLAB Plot
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GRIDLINES</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      contains routines to draw grid lines on MATLAB plots.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB's plotting commands include the "grid on" option, which
      places a certain number of grid lines on your plot.  However, if
      you don't like the choice of placement, linestyle, coloring, or
      the number of grid lines, changing these features, while possible,
      requires an extensive trip through MATLAB's plotting underworld.
    </p>

    <p>
      But gridlines are just lines, and you can use the <b>line</b> command
      to draw them.  The functions provided here do just that, with a
      reasonable interface that lets you select where and how many lines
      you want.  If you look inside the text of the functions, you can
      easily modify other features, such as the line color.
