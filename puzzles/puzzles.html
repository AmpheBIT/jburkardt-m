      CARD GAME PUZZLE
    </h3>

    <p>
      You are given a deck of CARD_NUM cards.  (We'll assume CARD_NUM is 100.)
      </p>

    <p>
      Your goal is to select the high card.  We can assume the cards are a permutation
      of the integers from 1 to CARD_NUM.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, your choice is made under the following rules:  You may turn over
      one card at a time.  When a card is turned over, you may declare that to be
      your choice, or else turn over another card.  If you have not chosen a card
      by the end, then your choice is the final card.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have no idea what to do, and simply decide in advance to pick
      a card "at random", that is, for example, you decide to pick the 15th card
      before having seen any cards, then your probability of winning is 1/CARD_NUM.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is, can you do better than that?
    </p>

    <p>
      Your strategy is as follows: always look at the first SKIP_NUM cards without
      choosing them.  Then choose the very next card you encounter that is larger
      than the cards you skipped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this program, you can easily see that skipping 5 cards is much better
      than picking one at random, skipping 10 is even better, and so on.  Of course,
      you can't skip too many cards, and in fact, the results seem to be best for
      somewhere around 30 to 35 cards skipped.  For problems like this, the
      optimal value is somewhere around 1 / e, where E is the base of the natural
      logarithm system.

      DIGIT PUZZLE
    </h3>

    <p>
      The seven digit puzzle
      <a href = "../../fun/puzzles/digit_puzzle.html">
      The Digit Puzzle</a>.  It wasn't hard to find the seven unique digits of an integer
      such that the integer was divisible by each digit.  But it was actually hard
      to figure out the order of the digits in the integer!  Some thought was able
      to whittle down the last few digits to a small collection, and we knew the
      integer had to be a multiple of the least common multiple of the digits,
      but no way was obvious to actually determine the integer.  At that point,
      Jeff Borggaard wrote the following MATLAB program to search for the answer.

      PERMUTATION PUZZLE
    </h3>

    <p>
      Let <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b> be arbitrary permutations of the integers
      from 1 to 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pair corresponding entries of the permutations to create
      the set of 10 points (P1(1),P2(1)) through (P1(10),P2(10)).  Now
      subtract 5, that is, <b>N/2</b>, from the X and Y coordinates of each point
      so that their average value is zero.  Then apply a rotation of 45 degrees to each vector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now instead of
      looking at 10 vectors (X(I),Y(I)), each of length 2, consider the
      data as two vectors <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>, each of length 10.
      If the instructions have been followed correctly, then <b>X</b>
      are <b>Y</b> are perpendicular to each other in 10-dimensional space.
    </p>

    <p>
       MATLAB code to verify a random example of this property is:
       <pre>
         n = 10;
         p1 = randperm ( n );
         p2 = randperm ( n );
         xy = [ p1; p2 ];
         xy = xy - ( n / 2 );
         angle = pi / 4;
         A = [ cos ( angle ), - sin ( angle ); ...
               sin ( angle ),   cos ( angle ) ];
         xy = A * xy;
         dot = xy(1,1:n) * xy(2,1:n)';
         fprintf ( 1, '  The dot product is %f\n', dot );
       </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Claim: This property is true for <i>any</i> pair of permutations <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Claim: This property is true even if <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b> are equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Claim: This property is true for <i>any</i> positive integer <b>N</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Claim: This property is <b>not</b> true for arbitrary values of the rotation angle.
      For instance, using an angle of pi/3 will not work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Claim: Let Q be an arbitary vector of length <b>N</b>.  Instead of
      <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b>, consider the vectors <b>Q1=Q(P1)</b> and
      <b>Q2=Q(P2)</b>.  The property is still true!
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        Puzzle: Can you verify that each of the claims is true?  Can you explain why?
      </i>
